And while it is reshaping the economic landscape, it hasn't left the kind of wreckage in its wake that some might have predicted - though of course there is often a lag before impact is fully seen. What's more, for many countries, this has all served as a wake up call - a need to remain alive to fresh alliances.And so, while the short term result might be - as Trump sees it - a victory, the impact on his overarching goals is far less certain. As are the long-term repercussions, which could well pan out rather differently for Trump - or the America he leaves behind after his current term.The '90 deals in 90 days' deadlineFor all the wrong reasons, 1 August had been ringed on international policymakers' calendars. Agree new trading terms with the US by then, they'd been warned – or face potentially ruinous tariffs.While White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted \"90 deals in 90 days\" and Trump offered an optimistic outlook on reaching agreements, the deadline always appeared to be a tall order. And it was.By the time the end of July rolled around, Trump had only announced about a dozen trade deals – some no more than a page or two long, without the kind of detailed provisions standard in past negotiations.REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/PoolThe baseline 10% applied to most British goods raised eyebrows at first – but was a relief compared to the 15% rate on other trading partnersThe UK was first off the blocks, perhaps inevitably. Trump's biggest bugbear is, after all, America's trade deficit, and trade is in broad balance when it comes to the UK.While the baseline 10% applied to most British goods may initially have raised eyebrows, it provided a hint of what was to follow – and in the end came as a relief compared to the 15% rate applied to other trading partners such as the EU and Japan, with whom the US has larger deficits; $240bn and $70bn respectively last year alone.And even those agreements came with strings attached. Those countries that weren't able to commit to, say, buying more American goods, often faced higher tariffs.South Korea, Cambodia, Pakistan - as the list grew, and tariff letters were fired off elsewhere, the bulk of American imports are now covered by either an agreement or a presidential decree concluded with a curt \"thank you for your attention to this matter\".Capacity to 'damage' the global economyMuch has been revealed as a result of this.First, the good news. The wrangling of the last few months means the most painful of tariffs, and recession warnings, have been dodged. The worst fears – in terms of tariff levels and potential economic fallout (for the US and elsewhere) - have not been realised.JOHN G MABANGLO/EPA/ShutterstockThe greatest fears - the warnings of potential disaster - have recededSecond, the agreement of tariff t",

The Israeli military said troops fired \"warning shots\" but that it was \"not aware of any casualties\".Israeli officials have threatened that if there is no progress in the coming days on a ceasefire and hostage release deal, then they may take new punitive steps against Hamas. Israeli media reported that those could include annexing parts of Gaza.Shortly after his envoy's arrival in Israel, US President Donald Trump wrote on social media: \"The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!\"Witkoff's Gaza visit is 'reflection of close work' US has been doing, says State Department spokesperson Tammy BruceWitkoff will visit Gaza a day after his meeting with Netanyahu, where they focused on \"dilemmas\" such as food and aid in Gaza, Leavitt said.The announcement comes after reports that he would visit food distribution sites run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).In Gaza, the health ministry said on Thursday that 111 people had been killed and 820 others injured by Israel's military offensive in the last 24 hours.In a separate statement, the ministry said two people had died of malnutrition in the past day, bringing the total number of malnutrition deaths since the start of the war to 159, including 90 children.On Tuesday, UN-backed global food security experts warned that the \"worst-case scenario of famine\" was \"currently playing out\" among the 2.1 million population.UN agencies have said there is man-made, mass starvation in Gaza and blamed Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies to Gaza. But Israel has insisted that there are no restrictions on aid deliveries and that there is \"no starvation\".Despite that, four days ago it implemented measures that it has said are aimed at helping the UN and its partners collect aid from crossings and distribute it within Gaza, including daily \"tactical pauses\" in military operations in three areas and the creation of what it calls \"designated humanitarian corridors\".The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday that 43 aid packages containing food for residents in southern and northern Gaza had been airdropped, and \"it would continue to work in order to improve the humanitarian response in the Gaza Strip, along with the international community\".The UN's humanitarian office has said the tactical pauses do not allow for the continuous flow of supplies required to meet the immense needs of the population, and that desperately hungry crowds continue to offload supplies from lorries as they pass through Israeli crossings.The director of al-Shifa hospital, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, told the BBC on Thursday morning that it had received the bodies of 54 people who were",

The new ballroom will be built alongside a \"modernised\" East Wing of the White House, which currently houses the offices of First Lady Melania Trump and other key White House posts. The money will be donated directly by Trump and other so-far anonymous donors, with work beginning in September, according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Trump has repeatedly promised to build a \"beautiful\" ballroom at the White House, and in 2016 offered to pay $100m during Barack Obama's administration - which the then-President rejected. Getty ImagesMany White House events are hosted in the much smaller East Room, with large tents set up on the South Lawn for larger events - sometimes with world leadersIn a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, Leavitt said that the \"much needed and exquisite addition\" to the White House will be approximately 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) with a seating capacity of about 650.Currently, many formal White House functions are held in the White House's East Room, which can seat approximately 200 people. The new ballroom, Leavitt added, would also eliminate the need for a \"large and unsightly tent\" to be installed for state dinners and other large events - which sometimes include world leaders. According to Leavitt, construction is expected to be completed \"long before\" the end of Trump's term in office in January 2029.\"The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organisations to preserving the special history of the White House, while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future administrations and generations of Americans to come,\" Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said in a statement. White HouseA rendering shows what the outside would look like of the renovated East Wing of the White House. The right portion of the building is the East Wing. Renderings provided by the White House show that the ballroom will be similar architecturally to the rest of the White House, with a lavish interior including chandeliers and ornate columns. \"The White House has a history of expansion to accommodate the changing needs of the nation's chief executive,\" Leslie Greene Bowman, who has served under four presidents on the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, told the BBC. \"I hope and trust that any proposed changes will honor and preserve the existing walls that have witnessed so much history. They are precious vessels of our legacy as a democracy.\"Offices currently housed in the East Wing of the White House adjacent to the construction - including that of First Lady Melania Trump - will be temporarily re-located. President Trump has repeatedly voiced his wishes for a new ballroom as part of renovations to the White House, which has already seen the installation of two large flagpoles, new gold decorations in the Oval Office and the bulldozing and paving over of the famed Rose Garden. Watch: \"It’s a disaster\" - Trump on need to replace event tent with new ballroom\"There's never been a President that's good at ballrooms,\" Trump said at an event at the White House on Thursday. \"I'm good at building things.\"Trump added that \"they've always had to get tents\" for large events at the White House, which he described as a disaster. \"It's not a pretty sight.\"Earlier this week during a Scotland meeting with European Council President Ursula Van der Leyen, Trump told her that \"we're building a great ballroom at the White House.\" \"No president knew how to build a ballroom,\" Trump said while sitting in another ballroom at his Turnberry golf resort. \"I could take this one, drop it right down there, and it would",

The US castigated these moves, having privately warned of diplomatic consequences if those attending the UN conference made \"anti-Israel\" declarations.In its sanctions announcement, the State Department accused the PA and PLO of taking actions to \"internationalise its conflict with Israel such as through the International Criminal Court (ICC) and International Court of Justice (ICJ)\".It also referred to a series of long-standing complaints by the US and Israel that the PLO and PA had continued \"to support terrorism including incitement and glorification of violence (especially in textbooks), and providing payments and benefits in support of terrorism to Palestinian terrorists and their families\". The Trump administration earlier this year lifted sanctions on violent Israeli settlers who have killed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.One leading Palestinian politician described the sanctions move as \"revenge\" by the US for the commitments to recognise Palestinian statehood by a growing number of countries.The PA appeared to echo that sentiment in a statement released on Thursday.\"These campaigns have been escalating in response to the significant and successive achievements of Palestinian diplomacy,\" it said.\"Particularly the recent recognitions of the State of Palestine by key countries, the successful United Nations conference in New York, and the historic declaration issued therein.\"ReutersBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced this week that the UK will recognise a Palestinian state in September unless Israel meets set conditionsMustafa Barghouti, founder of the Palestinian National Initiative (PNI) which is part of the PLO, said the US was targeting the wrong side.He told the BBC: \"Trump's administration, instead of punishing the criminals who are committing war crimes in Gaza and in the West Bank, which is Israel, is instead… punishing the victim, which is the Palestinian people.\"Israel welcomed the sanctions and thanked US Secretary of State Marco Rubio for imposing them.\"This important action by [President Trump] and his administration also exposes the moral distortion of certain countries that ran to recognise a virtual Palestinian state while turning a blind eye to its support for terror and incitement,\" said foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar.The PA has always rejected complaints around \"salaries\" saying the payments are stipends to the families of all Palestinian prisoners held under Israel's military occupation, many of whom are not given any due process and are held in breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Palestinians see all those detained by Israel and jailed by its military courts, which have a 99 per cent conviction rate, as political prisoners. French officials said last week the PA had expressed its willingness to end these payments in response to France's commitment to recognise a Palestinian state.This ",

The attack brought down an apartment block.A six-year-old boy and his mother were among the dead, as more than two dozen locations across the Ukrainian capital were hit. Ukraine's interior ministry said three children had died and 16 were among the wounded. Kyiv's mayor said it was the biggest number of children hurt in one night since the full-scale war began.Russian attacks have continued despite US President Donald Trump's threat to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow if Vladimir Putin does not agree to a ceasefire by 8 August.The toll was revised after \"rescuers retrieved 10 bodies from the rubble of the residential building in Sviatoshynsky district, including the body of a two-year-old child\", Ukraine's interior ministry posted on Telegram.\"Both Russia and Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a deal,\" acting US representative to the United Nations John Kelley told the UN Security Council on Thursday. \"President Trump has made clear this must be done by 8 August.\"The high-pitched hum of Russian drones could be heard for hours over the city, interrupted by the occasional loud thunder clap of a missile strike.Russia launched 309 drones and eight cruise missiles during the night, according to Ukraine's air force. And although officials say air defences did manage to destroy many of them, there were numerous hits including from cruise missiles.A red-orange glow indicated destruction on the ground.These were the biggest airstrikes since Trump brought forward an earlier deadline to Putin. The threat of more US sanctions appears to have done little to persuade the Russian president to change course.Meanwhile, Russia claimed further success on the battlefield, declaring that it had captured the strategically important hilltop town of Chasiv Yar in the eastern Donetsk region. Ukraine denied it had fallen, however, and military analysts said fighting there was continuing.Roman Petushkov/Global Images UkraineThree people were killed when an apartment block was brought downThree of the fatalities in Kyiv were at the site of the residential apartment block. \"An entire entrance was destroyed. Rescuers are clearing the rubble,\" said Ukraine's interior minister Ihor Klymenko.President Volodymyr Zelensky said the capital was the focus of Russia's overnight attacks.\"The world has yet again seen Russia's response to our, America's and Europe's desire for peace. More demonstrative murder,\" he said on social media. \"This is why peace without strength is impossible.\"Kyiv's Sviatoshynskyi and Solomyansky districts were hit hardest in the attack.The windows of a hospital ward for children in Shevchenkivskyi district were blown out by a shockwave, Kyiv's mayor said on Telegram.One of the city's higher education institutions, a school and a kindergarten were also damaged.Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said it was a \"horrible morning\" in Kyiv, and that there are \"still people under the rubble\". Sybiha added that Trump had been \"very generous and patient\" with Putin, but now it was time to put \"maximum pressure on Moscow\" through sanctions.ReutersEarlier in July, Trump set a 50-day deadline for the Kremlin to reach a truce with Kyiv or risk economic penalties.On Monday, during a visit to the UK, Trump cut that deadline to \"ten or 12 days\", expressing his disapproval at Putin's actions in Ukraine, more than three years since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of the country. Trump didn't say whether he felt the Russian president had been \"lying\" to him, but he said the",

They treated us like animals.\"He was speaking to the BBC earlier this month at Islam Qala on the two countries' border, before crossing back over to Afghanistan. His name has been changed to protect his identity.Iran - which says it hosts more than four million undocumented Afghans who fled conflict in their homeland - has been stepping up deportations for months. In March those without papers were given a July deadline to depart voluntarily, but since a brief war with Israel in June, the authorities have forcibly returned hundreds of thousands of Afghans, alleging national security concerns.Daily returns peaked at about 50,000 people in early July, according to the United Nations – often after arduous journeys.Ali Ahmad says Iranian officials confiscated his money and phone and left him without \"a single penny to travel back\". He'd lived in Iran for two and a half years.'Scapegoats'Iran's crackdown has coincided with widespread accusations linking Afghans to Israel's intelligence agency Mossad, including Iranian media reports that cite police sources claiming some individuals were arrested for espionage.\"We're afraid to go anywhere, constantly worried that we might be labelled as spies,\" one person, who wished to remain anonymous, told BBC News Afghan.\"You Afghans are spies\", \"You work for Israel\" or \"You build drones in your homes\", are other frequent accusations, according to this individual.Barnett Rubin, an expert on Afghanistan who served as senior adviser to the US Department of State, says Tehran may be \"looking for scapegoats\" for its shortcomings in the war against Israel.\"The Iranian government is very embarrassed by their security failures\", which show Iran \"was very thoroughly penetrated by Israeli intelligence\", he says.\"So they had to find someone to blame.\"Critics also say the accusations of espionage are aimed at buying legitimacy for the government's plan to deport undocumented Afghans.The BBC attempted to contact the Iranian government but did not receive a response. The return of Afghan refugees \"without tension and with respect for human rights… is a goal pursued at all levels\", the state-backed Islamic Republic News Agency said on 18 July.'Four days, like four years'Abdullah Rezaee, whose name has also been changed, has a similar story to Ali Ahmad.At the detention centre where he was held, about 15 Iranian officers physically harmed him and other deportees, Abdullah told the BBC at Islam Qala.\"Iranian police tore up my visa and passport and beat me severely. They accused me of being a spy.\"Getty ImagesIt is estimated that there are over 4 million undocumented Afghans living in Iran.Abdullah says he'd only been in Iran two months before being detained, despite having a visa.\"They beat us with plastic batons and said: 'You're a spy, you're ruining our country'.\"The four days he was detained \"felt like four years\". He describes constant mistreatment, physical abuse and lack of food.The online allegations of collaboration between Afghans and Israeli secret services started early in the war.On 13 June, the day Israel attacked Iranian nuclear and military facilities, the government issued statements to the population, asking citizens to report suspicious activities such as unusual movements of vans, which might be transporting Israeli operatives' weapons.Then Telegram channels with large followings posted warning messages using similar wording to the government's. But they added that the population should be vigilant of \"alien citizens\" – an e",

They were out in force again on Thursday.The MPs then entered parliament, the Rada, and took part in a vote that overwhelmingly overturned a law introduced by President Volodymyr Zelensky last week that curtailed the independence of two key anti-corruption agencies known as Nabu and Sap - the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office.Two MPs hold a cardboard placard that reads \"We are with the people\"The signs carried by the MPs outside the Rada were a nod to the placards carried by thousands of young people who had taken to the streets in towns and cities across Ukraine for almost a week.The protesters had demanded that Zelensky and his government \"take their hands off\" the two anti-corruption bodies, and they threatened to continue carry on until the government made a U-turn.Within days, it did.Zelensky's original bill had stripped the two bodies of their independent authority to decide who to prosecute in high-level corruption cases, giving that prerogative to the general prosecutor - a presidential appointee.For the placard-waving protesters, safeguarding the independence of Nabu and Sap was as crucial to their European future as the war against Russia was a matter of life and death for their country.In 2022, Kyiv was granted the coveted status of EU candidate country – but on condition it mounted a credible fight against corruption.For Ukraine's Western partners, donors and investors who pour money into the country through international assistance and funding programmes, the existence and independence of the two anti-corruption bodies are non-negotiable.And for Ukraine and its war-shattered economy – that external financial help is critical.It was only 10 days earlier that MPs had backed Zelensky's controversial law, and yet they voted on Thursday by 331 to 0 to overturn it. On both occasions they appeared to be following Zelensky's direction.\"Ukraine is a democracy - there are definitely no doubts,\" he said on social media.ReutersPresident Zelensky has sought to reassure Ukrainians that their democracy is in safe handsMany Ukrainians see the hand of Zelensky's right-hand man, Andriy Yermak, behind the president's recent choices.Yermak's position as head of the presidential office is not regulated by the constitution nor limited by any checks or balances. And questions are being asked about such a role in Ukraine's democracy.Safeguarding that democracy and Ukraine's course towards European integration were the key drivers for the young protesters, while their parents and friends were defending their country on the front lines.MPs did their best to show the problem was now solved, but this crisis has left behind an unpleasant aftertaste.It has brought into question Zelensky's dedication to the anti-corruption reforms.That he seemed ready to compromise on these reforms may have seriously dented the trust the EU put in him.Read more: Kyiv death tolls rises to 16 as wave of Russian strikes defies Trump demandZelensky backtracks on law after protestsUkrainecast: Can Zelensky recover from nationwide protests?Some made the link between the government's bid to curtail the independence of Nabu and Sap.

No wasps were found at the site near Aiken in South Carolina.Investigators say the contamination is not related to a nuclear waste leak, and that there was no impact to \"the environment, or the public\".Environmental groups have criticised the government's handling of the situation.The nest was discovered by workers who routinely inspect for nuclear radiation at the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, on 3 July. It was found on a post nearby to where millions of gallons of liquid nuclear waste are stored, but there was no leak from the waste tanks, the report said.Investigators attribute the dangerously-high levels found on the nest to what is called \"onsite legacy radioactive contamination\" - the residual radioactivity that remains from the time when the site was actively producing parts for nuclear bombs during the Cold War. The site opened in the 1950s, when it was creating plutonium to be used in the core of nuclear bombs. It continues to operate today, but with a focus on nuclear material for power plants.The energy department report notes that the wasps that lived within the nest would have significantly lower radiation levels than the nest itself. It also points out that wasps generally fly only a few hundred feet from their nest, and that the nest was found in the middle of the 310-square-mile Savannah River Site - meaning there is little chance they flew outside of the facility.\"No contamination was found in the area,\" the report notes. \"There were no impacts to workers, the environment or the public,\"Savannah River Site Watch, a watchdog group that monitors the site, said that many questions remain unanswered. \"I'm as mad as a hornet that SRS didn't explain where the radioactive waste came from or if there is some kind of leak from the waste tanks that the public should be aware of,\" spokesman Tom Clements told the Associated Press.The site once generated more than 165 million gallons (625 million litres) of liquid nuclear waste, according to Savannah River Mission Completion.There are still 43 of the underground tanks in use, while eight have been closed.WaspsRadiationNuclear weaponsUnited StatesRelatedCalls to report yellow-legged hornets in KentFirm tackling '40% rise' in callouts over waspsWasps are back this summer – a lot of themMore from the BBC27 mins agoTrump raises Canada trade tariff to 35%The president also announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, as he continued his drive to remake how global trade operates.27 mins ago1 hr agoSix things that may cost Americans more after Trump's tariffsEconomists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US.1 hr ago2 hrs agoWhat tariffs has Trump announced and why?Trump's volatile trade policy has thrown the world economy into chaos, and put some US prices up. 2 hrs ago4 hrs agoThree top officials were asleep or out of town when deadly Texas floods hit Officials have been criticised over the lack of warning ahead of the flash floods that killed at least 135 people. 4 hrs ago5 hrs agoFlooded streets and subway systems as storms slam US East CoastNew York and New Jersey have issued a state of emergency for areas hit by the strong storm system.5 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsArchiveCopyright 2025 BBC.

Other countries are still racing to finalise deals with the US to avoid sweeping levies.But since news of the US-EU deal was announced last weekend, not only has criticism mounted, but it has become clear many details are yet to be ironed out, there are several discrepancies between the two sides and some EU countries will be disproportionately affected.Only a first step?Few European leaders rejoiced at the announcement that a 15% tariff would be applied on most EU exports to the US - an improvement on the 30% tariff initially threatened by Trump, but still a substantial hike from the former 4.8% average rate.LIVE coverage: Trump raises Canada tariff to 35% as US announces new levies for dozens of countriesYet, while expressing regret that the EU had not adopted a tougher negotiating stance, many begrudgingly agreed the deal had at least brought a semblance of certainty and predictability to Europe's businesses after a number of fraught months.\"I would have wished for a different outcome,\" Germany's finance minister Lars Klingbeil said. \"Still, all in all, it is good that there is an agreement with the US, that there are no further escalations.\"As of Thursday, a joint statement had yet to be released, although the Commission has emphasised it will not be a legally binding document but a \"set of political commitments\". \"From there will flow the additional negotiated exemptions that we're looking to bake into our agreement with the US,\" Commission trade spokesperson Olof Gill said.The Commission's general outline of the deal stressed it was not legally binding.The White House fact sheet on the agreement presents none of these caveats and says it achieves \"historic structural reforms\", but US Commerce chief Howard Lutnick admitted on Wednesday that talks would continue and that EU and US officials were still discussing some aspects of the framework.\"This isn't the end of the story and we won't leave it at that,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said. \"It's the first step in a negotiation process that will continue.\"Trade agreements usually take between 18 and 24 months of bilateral negotiations, says Cinzia Alcidi of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels. \"To give some certainty to the industry and private sectors now, the 15% blanket tariff will apply – but then there will be efforts to get some goods a different deal,\" she says.Key discrepancies and interpretationsAccording to the White House, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors will fall under the 15% tariff, with no mention of that number being the upper limit. But the EU says the two sectors will remain on the current 0% rate for now and until new global tariff rates are agreed. Any future tariffs, according to the EU, will be capped at 15%.Tariffs on steel and aluminium, according to the US, will remain at 50%. The EU says Brussels and Washington will work to cut that number and that they will be replaced by a quota system to come beyond 1 August.Some of the most glaring discrepancies can be found in the language used by the two sides to describe the EU's investment commitments. Where the US statement says the EU \"will\" purchase $750bn (£568bn) in US oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear energy products, the EU says only that it \"intends\" to do so as it weans itself off Russian gas and oil.Not only is it unclear whether the US can even provide such amounts to the E",

Jordan confirmed he had died after a gruesome IS video appeared to show the 26-year-old being burned alive in a cage.Profile: Jordanian pilot Moaz al-KasasbehMan charged over killing of Jordanian pilot burned alive by ISKrayem had denied the charges, Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported, and said he was unaware of the plans for the killing.While the evidence showed that the fire that killed Lt Kasasbeh was lit by another man, Krayem was also involved in the killing, the court said.\"The defendant, through his actions, contributed so actively to the death of the pilot that he should be considered a perpetrator,\" presiding Judge Anna Liljenberg Gullesjo said in a statement.He was at the execution site \"uniformed and armed, and allowed himself to be filmed,\" the statement added.Krayem, 32, who is already serving a 30-year sentence for his role in the Paris attacks and a life term for the Brussels attacks, was given a second life sentence by the court in Stockholm.The judge added that Krayem's actions consisted of \"guarding the victim both before and during the execution and taking him to the cage where he was set alight\".The court also awarded compensation to Lt Kasasbeh's parents and siblings of around 80,000 Swedish kronor ($8,200/£6,198) each.Lt Kasasbeh was captured when his plane came down near the city of Raqqa during a mission against IS in December 2014.At the time of his death in early 2015, Jordan - which was part of a US-led coalition fighting IS in Syria - had been attempting to secure his release as part of a prisoner swap.\"It is painful for my parents to be confronted with this event again, but we are grateful that the Swedish authorities want to give us justice,\" the pilot's brother, Jawdat al-Kasasbeh, told Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Radio when charges were initially announced.Krayem is originally from the Swedish city of Malmo and is thought to have travelled to Syria in September 2014 to fight for IS.In June 2022, he was sentenced for his role in the November 2015 Paris attacks - in which 130 people were killed - and for planning a separate attack on Amsterdam airport.A year later, he was also found guilty of terrorist murder for his role in the Brussels attacks that killed 32 people.EuropeSwedenJordanIslamic State groupRelatedRussian missile hits Ukrainian training unit, killing and wounding servicemenFormer garda jailed for inciting rape Euro 2025 Lionesses kits outsell previous tournaments More from the BBC3 days agoWatch: BBC's Jeremy Bowen goes onboard a plane dropping aid into GazaThe BBC's international editor was on a Jordanian flight as it dropped supplies into Gaza.3 days ago7 days agoThe small Swedish club who made Gyokeres, Kulusevski & BergvallBrommapojkarna has Europe's biggest youth set-up and count Viktor Gyokeres, Dejan Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall among their graduates.7 days ago16 Jul 2025Three jailed over murder of Swedish hip-hop star in car parkThe hip-hop star's killing has been linked to a local gangland conflict. 16 Jul 202516 Jul 2025Rise in popularity of Swedish game 'Viking chess'The game dubbed Viking chess is becoming better known and is being dominated by a Bristol team.16 Jul 202510 Jul 2025Swedish minister reveals teenage son linked to extremist g",

Footage showed emergency teams wading through chest-high water trying to rescue those trapped in the home in the Miyun District. Many of those who died were reportedly immobile. Local officials have admitted there were \"loopholes in emergency planning\" and said the incident was a painful lesson that served as \"a wake-up call\".A total of 44 people have died in the Beijing floods, which have come during a summer of extreme weather across China. Record heatwaves hit the eastern regions earlier this month while separate floods swept the country's south-west.About 77 elderly residents were inside the home when the floods hit, trapping about 40 of them as water levels rose to almost 2m (6ft), according to Chinese media. The facility - situated in Taishitun Town - primarily cares for those who are severely disabled, low-income, or receiving minimal living allowances, local media reports. \"For a long time, the central area of the town where the nursing home is located had been considered safe, so it was not included in the evacuation scope of the plan,\" a Chinese official said at a press conference on Thursday.\"This reveals that there are loopholes in our emergency planning. Our understanding of extreme weather has been insufficient, and this painful lesson has served as a wake-up call.\"In nearby Hebei province, 16 people died as a result of extreme rainfall, officials said. In the city of Chengde, eight were killed, with 18 still unaccounted for.Beijing is no stranger to flooding, particularly in the summer months. One of the deadliest in recent memory occurred in July 2012, when 190mm of rain drenched the city in a day, killing 79 people.This summer, floods have wreaked havoc across swathes of China.Two people were killed and 10 people went missing in Shandong province earlier this month when Typhoon Wipha struck eastern China. Two weeks earlier, a landslide killed three people in Ya'an city, in the country's south-west.Extreme weather, which experts link to climate change, has increasingly threatened China's residents and economy - especially its trillion-dollar agriculture sector.Natural disasters in the first half of the year have cost China 54.11 billion yuan ($7.5bn; £5.7bn), its emergency management ministry said earlier this month.

Ms Pierce told MIT Technology Review her family thought \"it's like something from a sci-fi movie\".It is believed to be longest that an embryo has been frozen before resulting in a successful live birth. The previous record-holder was a pair of twins who were born in 2022 from embryos frozen in 1992.The Pierces had tried to have a child for seven years before they decided to adopt the embryo Linda Archerd, 62, made with her then-husband in 1994 through IVF. At the time, Ms Archerd initially created four embryos. One became her now-30-year-old daughter, and the other three were left in storage. Despite separating from her husband, she did not want to get rid of the embryos, donate them for research or give them to another family anonymously.She said it was important that she was involved with the baby, as they would be related to her adult daughter. Ms Archerd paid thousands of dollars a year for storage until she found a Christian embryo adoption agency, Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which runs a programme known as Snowflakes. Many of these agencies consider their programmes to be saving lives. The programme used by Ms Archerd allows donors to choose a couple, meaning they can state religious, racial and nationality preferences.Ms Archerd's preference was for a married Caucasian, Christian couple living in the US, as she didn't want to \"go out of the country\", she told MIT Technology Review. She ultimately matched with the Pierces. The IVF clinic in Tennessee at which the couple underwent the procedure, Rejoice Fertility, said its aim was to transfer any embryo it received, no matter the age or conditions.Ms Pierce said she and her husband did not set out to \"break any records\", but just \"wanted to have a baby\".Ms Archerd told MIT Technology Review she had not met the baby in person yet, but could already see a resemblance with her daughter.

Her climbing partner, Marina Eva, called emergency services after the accident, which occurred at about 5,700 metres (18,700 feet) altitude. Rescue teams, containing expert climbers from Germany and the United States, immediately began a rescue mission but their searches were hindered by adverse weather conditions.Dahlmeier's management company said on Wednesday that it is likely she died on 28 July - the day of the accident.\"It was Laura's clear and written wishes that in an instance such as this, no one should risk their own lives in order to rescue her,\" a statement posted to Dahlmeier's Instagram read.\"Her wish was that in this case her body should be left behind on the mountain.\"This is also in line with the express wishes of the relatives, who have requested Laura's last wishes be respected.\"A recovery operation was launched before being called off on the evening of 29 July.\"The recovery of the body under the current prevailing conditions of rockfalls and changeable weather on Laila Peak is attached to a high risk and not achievable,\" the statement continued.\"Laura enriched the lives of many with her warm and straightforward manner.\"She showed us that it is worth standing up for your dreams and goals and always staying true to yourself.\"The German Olympic Sports Confederation said Dahlmeier was \"more than an Olympic champion - she was someone with heart, attitude and vision\".International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry said Dahlmeier's death is \"deeply shocking for all of us in the Olympic movement\".She added: \"She lost her life in her beloved mountains. She will be remembered forever.\"German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Dahlmeier was an \"ambassador for our country around the world and a role model for peaceful, joyful and fair coexistence across borders\".Dahlmeier, an experienced mountaineer, represented Germany at two Winter Olympics, winning two golds and one bronze medal in Pyeongchang in 2018.She was the first woman to win the sprint and pursuit events at the same Games and won a further 15 medals, including seven gold, across five World Championships before retiring from competition in May 2019.Related topicsWinter SportsTop storiesUnreachable to unplayable - how England had mixed opening day Published9 hours agoVerstappen says he will race with Red Bull in 2026Published13 hours agoSarr scores incredible long-range goal as Spurs beat ArsenalPublished13 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCYour first preview of the historical epic, King and ConquerorIs a home educating community teaching children conspiracies?Inside the Jesus Army, from hippy origins to controlling cultWhat if the Earth spun backwards?Elsewhere in Sport'I'd be lost without football' - the ex-Premier League striker playing at 49Sarr scores incredible long-range goal as Spurs beat Arsenal.

The levies went as high as 49% on some countries, hitting a range of industries from electronics exporters in Thailand and Vietnam to chip makers in Malaysia and clothing factories in Cambodia. \"I remember waking up in the morning. It was quite early, and seeing him standing there on the White House lawn with his board. I thought: 'Did I see that right? 36%? How could it be?\" says Richard Han, whose father founded Hana Microelectronics, one of Thailand's biggest contract manufacturers.Thailand, which was facing a 36% levy, now has a deal, like most of its neighbours, to reduce the tariffs to 19%. The negotiations went down to the wire, finalised just two days before the deadline Trump had set - 1 August. It has been a fraught process getting there, and there is still very little detail about exactly what has been agreed.Live Updates: Trump raises Canada tariff to 35% as US announces new levies for dozens of countriesWhat tariffs has Trump announced and why?BBC/ Lulu LuoRichard Han says the 36% levy on Thailand was a \"shock\" The 10 countries in Asean, as the South East Asian regional bloc is known, exported $477bn (£360bn) worth of goods to the United States in 2024. Vietnam is by far the most exposed economy, its exports to the US totalling $137bn, making up about 30% of its GDP. No surprise then that the Vietnamese government was first off the block to negotiate with the US, and the first in the region to do a deal to cut the punishing 46% rate Trump had imposed on them.According to the US president, the deal cuts the tariffs to 20%, while he claims Vietnam will now impose no tariffs at all on any imports from the US. Tellingly, the Vietnamese leadership has said nothing about the deal. There are no details, no written or signed documents, and some reports suggest Vietnam does not agree with Trump's numbers. But they set the bar for other countries in the region. Indonesia and the Philippines followed with deals reducing their tariffs to 19%, although neither country depends much on exports to the US.Thailand does export a lot to the US. Last year they earned it more than $63bn, about one-fifth of its total exports. Thailand too should have been at the head of the queue in Washington, pleading for a reduction in the 36% tariff Trump had designated for it. Getty ImagesThailand's acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai took office after the last PM stepped down over a political scandalBut Thailand is not Vietnam, a one-party communist state where critical decisions can be made quickly by a few leaders, with little need to worry about the opinions of businesses or the public.Rather, like South Korea and Japan, whose deals came after much wrangling despite them being staunch American allies, Thailand too has to contend with domestic politics and public opinion. Thailand also has a weak and fractious coalition government, beholden to a range of vested interests. Worse still, decisions it took which were entirely unrelated to trade angered the US side. In February it sent 40 Uyghur asylum-seekers who had been stuck in Thailand for more than a decade back to China, defying warnings by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. One Thai trade official told the BBC the US negotiators were still bringing up the Uyghurs as a grievance at tariff talks in May. Then a regional army commander filed a lèse-majesté complaint against a US academic, resulting in him being jailed and then forced to leave Thailand. So, far from being at the front, Thailand found itself at t",

Mr Udaiyappan and his team are \"migrant workers\" - a term used in Singapore to describe the 1.17 million labourers who come to the wealthy city state from lower-income countries like Bangladesh, India and Myanmar.A vast majority of them work low-paying and labour intensive jobs that Singaporeans shun.This is not the first time migrant workers have served as first responders to save lives in Singapore. In April, four of them helped rescue children trapped in a shophouse after a fire broke out.Their recent actions have revived a debate on the rights – or lack thereof – of low-wage labourers in Singapore.How a pandemic exposed Singapore's inequalitiesThe migrant workers living in perpetual lockdownSingapore's fast-growing economy is built on the backs of these workers who make up nearly three quarters of the country's foreign workforce. Many of them work in sectors like construction, marine shipyards and manufacturing.Singapore has no minimum wage for migrant workers which means some can earn as little as S$300 ($233; £175) a month according to advocacy groups. They live in crowded dormitories that are often situated away from residential areas. They are also often subject to abuses by recruitment agencies and their employers, including overwork, unpaid labour and poor living conditions. These issues are well-documented, but activists say little has changed over the years.\"Today, you celebrate them. Tomorrow, you will go back to generalising them as cheats, liars and dirty,\" social worker Suraendher Kumarr wrote on Instagram, in response to the sinkhole incident.During the Covid pandemic in 2020, their living conditions were laid bare after worker dormitories emerged as a virus hotbed, with hundreds of workers testing positive daily. It sparked a public discussion about their conditions - which advocates had for decades warned about – and authorities later took action to improve dormitory standards.Another persistent issue, on which the sinkhole incident has again cast a spotlight, is the use of flat-bed trucks to ferry these workers.\"There is something poignantly poetic about the fact that migrant workers, likely transported on the backs of lorries, went out of their way to save a Singaporean in her car,\" said Mr Kumarr, who is a member of rights group Workers Make Possible.Singapore laws prohibit people from travelling on the cargo decks of such trucks – except in medical emergencies. But it is allowed if they are employed by the owners of the trucks.Sometimes, as many as 12 workers get packed into the back of a flat-bed truck with no seatbelts on. This is an economical option for many employers who also use the trucks to transport goods. But this has led to multiple accidents, some involving deaths. In April 2021, two foreign workers died and more than a dozen were wounded after the lorry they were in crashed into a stationary flat-bed truck. In 2024, at least four workers were killed and more than 400 injured in similar accidents.BBC/Gavin ButlerActivists have for years lobbied to ban the practice of ferrying workers on lorriesActivists have long lobbied to ban this mode of transportation – the issue has also b",

I had to move my hand to show them that I was alive.\"Doctors in Gaza saved his life and Majd spent months in hospital, breathing through a tracheostomy tube, before he was evacuated to Egypt in February this year - with Israel's permission - for further medical treatment.Now he's in the UK for surgery at Great Ormond Street children's hospital in London to restore the function of his face. He is the first Gazan child to arrive in the UK for treatment for war injuries, almost two years into a conflict in which more than 50,000 children have reportedly been killed or injured, according to the UN children's charity, Unicef. 'They thought I was dead', Majd tells the BBCHis arrival follows months of work by a group of volunteer medical professionals who came together in November 2023 to set up Project Pure Hope, which helps injured and sick Gazan children get to the UK for treatment. It is funded by private donations.\"The UK is home to some of the best paediatric facilities in the world, yet while countries like the US, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and many others have stepped up to help, the UK has yet to do the same,\" Project Pure Hope says.Majd's arrival in the UK comes less than a week after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer promised to evacuate more badly injured children, although the government has released few details of the plan.Majd's medical team – all working for free – will include craniofacial, plastic and orthodontic surgeons, with hospital bills paid for by private donations.\"If we're able to give him a face and a jaw which he can use then it won't be completely normal, but hopefully he'll be able to feed himself and speak, and his facial expressions will be better,\" says lead surgeon Noor ul Owase Jeelani, a professor of Paediatric Neurosurgery at Great Ormond Street.\"Hopefully that's going to make a big impact on how he lives and on his future.\"Our hope is that we will be able to help many more children like him in the coming months. It's our collective moral responsibility.\"Doctors from the hospital have previously treated patients from Ukraine, and last year helped separate co-joined twins in Israel.Professor Jeelani is disappointed that it has taken so long for the first child from Gaza to be treated for war injuries in the UK.\"As a doctor and as a human, I don't quite understand why it's taken us over 20 months to get to this stage,\" he says.Project Pure Hope has identified 30 critically injured children in Gaza who it hopes to help bring to the UK. It says the government's announcement is \"vital and long-overdue\", but time is of the essence.\"Every day of delay risks the lives and futures of children who deserve a chance to live, to recover and to rebuild a life,\" said Omar Din, its co-founder.Ghena (left) and Rama in a playground in the UKIn April, the group of volunteers secured visas for two girls -13-year-old Rama and five-year-old Ghena - with life-long medical conditions to also have privately funded operations in the UK.They were brought to London after being evacuated to Egypt from Gaza, where - with the destruction of the healthcare system there - they weren't receiving the treatment they needed.Since I met them in early May, Rama has put on weight ",

No Israeli re-occupation of Gaza after the war ends. No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. A future governance that must be Palestinian-led, involving the internationally backed Palestinian Authority. No role for Hamas.The principles were intended to generate support from America's allies in Europe and parts of the Arab world - even if Israel objected to many of them. Few probably remember Blinken declaring his Tokyo Principles - least of all the Trump administration, which immediately jettisoned them. But the ideas are still supported by many US allies, who travelled to the United Nations in New York this week for a French-Saudi-led conference calling for a rekindling of the two-state solution. Watch: How did Gaza get to the brink of starvation?The conference made headlines as France, then the UK, committed to recognising a Palestinian state later this year under certain conditions. On Wednesday afternoon, Canada followed suit. But the Trump administration boycotted the meeting, viewing it as anti-Israel.\"The United States will not participate in this insult but will continue to lead real-world efforts to end the fighting and deliver a permanent peace,\" said US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, deriding the conference as a \"publicity stunt\".Now, a chasm has opened up between the US and its traditional allies on the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.This raises a question: Does the Trump administration have a vision for the future governance of Gaza and longer-term permanent peace?It is becoming increasingly clear that it doesn't - at least not one of its own. Earlier this month, I asked Ms Bruce what the administration's vision was for the future governance of Gaza, beyond its requirement that Hamas cannot exist.She responded that \"countries, our partners in the region\" were working to implement \"new ideas\" the president had asked for. When I pressed her on what this involved she said: \"I won't exactly tell you today.\"No Gaza 'riviera' - but another plan uncertainIn February, President Trump declared that the US would take over the Gaza Strip and build a \"riviera of the Middle East\" in a plan that involved the forced displacement of Palestinians in the territory, which the US and Israel later tried to claim meant \"voluntary\" emigration.Whilst the idea was clearly unfeasible and would be in violation of international law, it appeared to be Trump's post-war plan. It would presumably have involved Israeli military occupation of the strip to facilitate it. It was not clear how any continuing insurgency by Hamas or aligned armed groups would have been defeated.Since then, the plan has been slowly, quietly dropped - at least in its fuller form. Asked on Tuesday about his plan to move Palestinians Trump described it as \"a concept that was really embraced by a lot of people, but also some people didn't like it\". The latter was probably a reference to rejection by Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia",

Due to Israel's military occupation, in the West Bank, the Palestinian authority, set up in the wake of peace agreements in the 1990s, is not in full control of its land or people. Gaza, where Israel is also the occupying power, is in the midst of a devastating war. Given its status as a kind of quasi-state, recognition is inevitably somewhat symbolic. It will represent a strong moral and political statement but change little on the ground.But the symbolism is strong. As Foreign Secretary David Lammy pointed out during his speech at the UN on Tuesday, \"Britain bears a special burden of responsibility to support the two-state solution\".Bettmann via Getty ImagesBritish troops lower the Union Flag to officially end British rule in Palestine in 1948He went on to cite the 1917 Balfour Declaration - signed by his predecessor as foreign secretary Arthur Balfour - which first expressed Britain's support for \"the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".But that declaration, Lammy said, came with a solemn promise \"that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine\".Supporters of Israel have often pointed out that Lord Balfour did not refer explicitly to the Palestinians or say anything about their national rights.But the territory previously known as Palestine, which Britain ruled through a League of Nations mandate from 1922 to 1948, has long been regarded as unfinished international business.Israel came into being in 1948, but efforts to create a parallel state of Palestine have foundered, for a multitude of reasons.As Lammy said, politicians \"have become accustomed to uttering the words 'a two-state solution'\".The phrase refers to the creation of a Palestinian state, alongside Israel, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.But international efforts to bring about a two-state solution have come to nothing and Israel's colonisation of large parts of the West Bank, illegal under international law, has turned the concept into a largely empty slogan. Who recognises Palestine as a state?The State of Palestine is currently recognised by 147 of the UN's 193 member states.At the UN, it has the status of a \"permanent observer state\", allowing participation but no voting rights.With France also promising recognition in the coming weeks and assuming the UK does go ahead with recognition, Palestine will soon enjoy the support of four of the UN Security Council's five permanent members (the other two being China and Russia).This will leave the United States, Israel's strongest ally by far, in a minority of one.Washington has recognised the Palestinian Authority, currently headed by Mahmoud Abbas, since the mid-1990s but has stopped short of recognising an actual state. Several US presidents have expressed their support for the eventual creation of a Palestinian state. But Do",

Trump said Canada had \"failed to cooperate\" in curbing the flow of fentanyl and other drugs across the US border, something Prime Minister Mark Carney insisted earlier this month his country was making \"vital progress\" towards.But most goods from Canada will dodge the high rate imposed by the US, thanks to the existing trade treaty called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), according to the Royal Bank of Canada.The president also announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, as he continued his drive to remake how global trade operates.Nearly 90% of Canadian goods imported into the US are exempted under the free trade deal, including fresh produce, energy exports and many industrial goods, RBC said.However, some imports like dairy products, wood and leather may still face tariffs depending on how talks shape up.The decision, contained in an executive order, increases the rate from 25% and came into effect at 00:01 US East Coast time (05:01 BST) on Friday.As the clock ticked towards Trump's Friday deadline to strike trade deals, he announced goods from Mexico would be charged at current rates for another 90 days, avoiding a threatened increase to 35%.However senior White House officials said their Canadian counterparts were less constructive in negotiations than Mexico, prompting the 35% tariff on Ottawa.Other countries affected by the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs will have seven days before they kick in.Goods that are loaded onto ships by 7 August and those that are already in transit will also not be affected by the rates if they reach the US before 5 October.Published by the White House, the orders leave most goods coming into the US facing new taxes of between 10% and 50%.Few nations have been spared in the latest list of tariff rates. Even small economies like Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea in the Asia-Pacific region were issued 15% duties.Countries not mentioned on the list face baseline duties of 10%.Follow live coverage hereHow much cash is the US raising from tariffs?The tariffs, which are a tax on imports, hit Asian countries hard.Two major trading partners in the region - India and Taiwan - were hit with levies of 25% and 20% respectively.Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te said the levy was only \"temporary\", vowing to complete talks with Washington for a deal.And land-locked South East Asian nation Laos is facing the second-highest rate in this round of tariffs. At 40% it sits just behind Syria's unenviable 41%.A day earlier, Trump reached a deal with South Korea, imposing a 15% tariff on its imports in return for investment in the US and other concessions. Economists and financial analysts have warned that the new levies will raise prices for businesses and consumers in the US and weigh on the economy, predictions that the Trump administration has dismissed.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that Trump was \"proving the so-called economic experts wrong at every turn\".\"What we are watching is President Trump rebuilding the greatest economy in the history of the world,\" she said.Follow BBC's coverage of US tariffsANALYSIS: How much cash is the US raising from tariffs?EXPLAINER: What tariffs has Trump announced and why?CONSUMERS: Six things that will get more expensive for AmericansGetty ImagesProtests against Trump's tariffs took place in South Korea this weekThe escalation of the tariffs had been telegraphed for months, starting when Trump unveiled sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs in April, saying they would rebalance global trade flows and reduce America's trade deficit - the gap between what it buys and sells abroad.

It added: \"Intentional harm to civilians, especially children, is strictly prohibited.\" Layan and Mira are just two of more than 160 cases of children shot in the war in Gaza, for whom we have gathered accounts. We found that in 95 of these cases, the child had been shot in the head or chest. In 59 of those, we obtained testimony from eyewitnesses, either directly or via human rights organisations and medics. The witnesses alleged that 57 of these children were shot by the IDF, and two were shot by Palestinians - one in celebratory gunfire and the other in a gang conflict.For the remaining 36 out of the 95 cases, we have no account of what happened. Israel bans foreign reporters from entering Gaza independently, and the destruction and displacement make gathering details difficult.The International Committee of the Red Cross has told the BBC the world cannot accept as a \"new normal\" the type of warfare that allows so many children to be shot.31 minutes agoIsrael & the PalestiniansGazaIsraelMiddle EastIsrael-Gaza warShareSavePM: UK will recognise Palestinian state unless conditions metPM: UK will recognise Palestinian state unless conditions met3 days agoMiddle East'All the people are hungry': Voices from Gaza on desperate lack of foodAll week across the BBC we've been hearing from people in Gaza about their lives as food supplies are restricted leading to malnourishment and starvation.7 days agoMiddle EastNato boss commends 'daddy' Trump's handling of Israel-Iran conflictMark Rutte appears to approve of the US president's strong language when Trump spoke about the warring nations on Tuesday.25 Jun 2025Middle EastWatch: BBC's Lyse Doucet reports from Iran on the ceasefire with IsraelLyse Doucet reports from the streets of Tehran, where she says things are staring to return to normal. 25 Jun 2025Middle EastTrump in angry outburst aimed at Israel and IranThe US president expressed his frustration at the conduct of the two nations. 24 Jun 2025Middle East'It took a direct hit' - BBC at scene of Beersheba missile strikeAt least four people were killed when an Iranian missile hit a residential building, Israeli officials say.24 Jun 2025Middle EastWatch: Video shows aftermath of Israeli strikes on IranFootage has emerged showing smoke billowing over Tehran and the city of Karaj, west of the capital.23 Jun 2025Middle EastNetanyahu and Trump 'totally aligned' on Iran - BarkatThe Israeli minister tells the BBC that his PM and the US president have been collaborating \"from day one\".23 Jun 2025Middle EastWatch: Iranian missile blast caught on dashcam in IsraelThe missile appeared to strike near a power station in the city of Ashdod.23 Jun 2025Middle EastSatellite images and decoy planes: Behind the US attacks on IranIt took months of planning and included over 125 planes, a submarine and 14 \"bunker buster\" bombs.

At least ten people were killed in the protests, which prompted authorities to crack down on Khan's party.During National Assembly elections in 2024, PTI members running as independent candidates won the most seats, but were blocked from forming government.

Judge Rob Kelly, Kerr County's top executive, said he was out of town. The downpour and flash flood killed at least 135 people in the state, while hundreds of others were forced to evacuate their homes.Kerr County was the hardest hit, where at least 95 people - including those at the all-girls Camp Mystic - were killed.In the wake of the deadly tragedy, officials were criticised and questioned over whether adequate warnings were provided and what top officials were doing. Mr Thomas, in his first public remarks since the disaster, explained that he had been feeling ill in the days leading up to the flood, and \"remained in bed\" throughout 3 July. \"My supervisors and the sheriff's office leadership were aware I was off-duty,\" he testified. He said there was no indication that day about the flood risk or the disaster that would later strike.Mr Thomas told state lawmakers that he was woken up around 05:30 (11:30 BST) the next morning, when he was asked to immediately report to the sheriff's office. Sheriff Larry Leitha testified that he went to bed on 3 July \"with zero worries\".He said the weather report at the time shared \"good news that we were finally about to get some rain\", and added that he had \"no idea, no warning\" about the catastrophe that was about to unfold. EPAMore than 130 people were killed in the deadly flash floods over the 4 July weekend Judge Rob Kelly, whose position functions as the county's chief executive officer, testified that he was away \"at our lake house preparing for a family gathering\".He also said that there was no flood alerts issued in the days before the disaster, and the intense flooding wasn't forecast by the National Weather Service.Questions have been raised about whether authorities provided adequate flood warnings before the disaster, and why people were not evacuated earlier.Experts say there were a number of factors that contributed to the tragedy in Texas, including extreme weather, the location of some homes and timing.Governor Greg Abbott said authorities had issued a storm warning and knew about a possible flash flood, but \"didn't know the magnitude of the storm\".'Huge wall of water': Texas man stood on meter box to survive deadly floodsNumber of missing in deadly Texas floods drops to threeFloodsTexasUnited StatesRelatedCity's £2m flood prevention scheme approvedFlooded streets and subway systems as storms slam US East CoastHeavy rain causes flash-flooding on Isle of WightMore from the BBC10 mins agoTrump raises Canada trade tariff to 35%The president also announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, as he continued his drive to remake how global trade operates.10 mins ago54 mins agoSix things that may cost Americans more after Trump's tariffsEconomists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US.54 mins ago1 hr agoWhat tariffs has Trump announced and why?Trump's volatile trade policy has thrown the world economy into chaos, and put some US prices up. 1 hr ago5 hrs agoDestination: Africa - Is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent?Two African nations have taken criminals from other countries deported from the US.5 hrs ago5 hrs agoWhite House unveils plans for new $200m ballroom Donald Trump has been calling for the White House to build a new ballroom for nearly a decade.5 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideo",

Indian woman lawyer mounts challenge5 hours agoShareSaveCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiShareSaveGetty ImagesYoung couples in India often retreat to secluded public spots for moments of intimacyIn late July, lawyer Indira Jaising mounted a challenge against the legal age for having sex in India - which is 18 years - in the Supreme Court, renewing conversations around the criminalisation of teen sex.Ms Jaising argued that consensual sex between 16 and 18-year-olds is neither exploitative nor abusive and urged the court to exempt it from criminal prosecution.\"The purpose of age-based laws is to prevent abuse, not to criminalise consensual, age-appropriate intimacy,\" Ms Jaising has said in her written submissions to the court.But the federal government has opposed this, saying that introducing such an exemption would jeopardise the safety and protection of children (persons under the age of 18, according to Indian laws), opening them up to abuse and exploitation.The case has re-ignited debate around consent and whether Indian laws, especially the country's main law against child sexual abuse - Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 or Pocso - should be altered to introduce a provision exempting 16 to 18 year-olds having consensual sex from their ambit.Child rights activists say exempting teens protects their autonomy, while opponents warn it could fuel crimes like trafficking and child marriage.Experts question whether teens can bear the burden of proof if abused. More importantly, who decides the age of consent laws - and whose interests do they truly serve?Like many countries, India has struggled to set its age of sexual consent. Unlike the US, where it varies by state, India enforces a uniform age nationwide.India's legal age for having sex is also much higher than most European countries, or places like UK and Canada, where it is 16.It was 10 years when India's criminal code was enacted in 1860 and was increased to 16 in 1940 when the code was amended.Pocso introduced the next major change, pushing the \"age of consent\" to 18 years in 2012. A year later, India's criminal laws were amended to reflect this change and the country's new criminal code, introduced in 2024, has adhered to this revised age.Why is consensual teen sex a crime in India?But over the past decade or so, many child rights activists and even courts have taken a critical view of the country's legal age to have sex and have called for it to be lowered to 16 years. They say the law criminalises consensual teen relationships and is often misused by adults to control or block relationships - especially those of girls.Sex remains a taboo topic in the country even though studies have shown that millions of Indian teenagers are sexually active.\"As a society, we're also divided along caste, class and religious lines, which makes the [age of consent] law even more susceptible to misuse,\" says Sharmila Raje, co-founder of Foundation for Child Protection-Muskaan, a non-profit working to prevent child sexual abuse for over two decades.Getty ImagesMany schools in India do not have sex education as part of the curriculumIn 2022, the Karnataka High court directed India's Law Commission - an executive panel that advices the government on legal reform - to rethink the age of consent under Pocso, \"so as to take into consideration the ground realities\".It noted several cases where girls over 16 fell in love, eloped, and had sex, only for the boy to be charged with rape and abduction under Pocso and criminal law.In its report the following year, the Law Commission ruled out lowering the age of consent, but recommended \"guided judicial discretion\" during sentencing in cases involving \"tacit approval\" from children aged 16 to 18 years, meaning where the relationship has been consensual.Though this is yet to be implemented, courts across the country have been using this principle to allow for appeals, grant bail, make acquittals and even quash cases aft",
