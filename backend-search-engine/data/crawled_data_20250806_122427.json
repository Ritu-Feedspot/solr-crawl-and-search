Back pain is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, but an AI-powered app is being used to help patients in the UK to manage their symptoms. But how does it measure up?

AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour. 23 Aug 2024 29 Jul 2024 Is it possible for AI to fake a sense of humour? We asked a professional comedian to deliver jokes written by artificial intelligence on stage. It revealed a lot about how much machines understand the human humour. 29 Jul 2024 26 Jul 2024 Can AI tell funnier jokes than a human? In a clash of wit and technology, we bring together two unlikely adversaries: a comedian and an AI chatbot. 26 Jul 2024 14 Jun 2024 How to apologise effectively If you're struggling to say you're sorry, AI is happy to help.

    "body": "UN official says Israel expanding Gaza operations would risk 'catastrophic consequences' 1 hour ago Share Save Yolande Knell Middle East correspondent Yang Tian BBC News Share Save Watch: UN official says Netanyahu's reported Gaza expansion plans risk \"catastrophic consequences\" A top UN official has warned there would be \"catastrophic consequences\" if Israel expands its military operations in Gaza, after reports Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing for total reoccupation. Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenča told the UN Security Council such a move would be \"deeply alarming\", and could endanger the lives of more Palestinians, as well as Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu plans to meet his security cabinet this week. \"The die has been cast. We're going for the full conquest of the Gaza Strip - and defeating Hamas,\" a senior Israeli official was quoted as saying. The security cabinet, which is due to meet on Thursday, would need to approve such an action. It has been suggested the plan could be a negotiating tactic to pressure Hamas after a recent breakdown of ceasefire talks, or an attempt to shore up support from Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners. Asked whether he would support an Israeli plan to reoccupy all of Gaza, US President Donald Trump responded: \"That's pretty much going to be up to Israel.\" Israel has been facing mounting international pressure over the war in Gaza, where experts say famine is unfolding. In his remarks, Jenča warned against any expansion of Israel's military operations. \"This would risk catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians and could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza,\" he said. He added that under international law, Gaza \"is and must remain an integral part of a future Palestinian state\". Israel's military said it already had operational control of 75% of Gaza, but the new plan would reportedly propose occupying the entire region - including areas where more than two million Palestinians now live. The proposals have proved divisive in Israel, with reports the army chief and other military leaders oppose the strategy. The unnamed Israeli official responded by saying: \"If that doesn't work for the chief of staff, he should resign.\" The families of hostages have expressed their fear that such a decision could endanger their loved ones. Israel says 49 hostages are still being held in Gaza, of whom 27 are believed to be dead. Jenča reiterated to the UN Security Council the call for a ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Citing the \"squalid\" and \"inhumane\" conditions faced by Palestinians, he urged Israel to immediately allow the unimpeded passage of sufficient aid. \"Israel continues to severely restrict humanitarian assistance entering Gaza, and the aid that is permitted to enter is grossly inadequate,\" Jenča said. He also condemned the ongoing violence at food distribution sites, saying more than 1,200 Palestinians have been killed since the end of May while trying to access food and supplies. Last week, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 154 people including 89 children had died from a lack of food since October 2023. UN agencies have warned there is man-made, mass starvation in Gaza, and reported at least 63 malnutrition-related deaths this month. Israel has previously insisted there are no restrictions on aid deliveries and that there is \"no starvation\" in Gaza. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign, according to the territory's health ministry.

    "body": "Despite Trump's peace calls, Russian attacks on Ukraine double since inauguration 7 hours ago Share Save Matt Murphy & Ned Davies BBC Verify Share Save Reuters Russia has more than doubled the number of drones and missiles fired towards Ukraine since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, a BBC Verify analysis has found, despite his calls for a ceasefire. Attacks had already been rising under former President Joe Biden in 2024 but climbed sharply after Trump's election victory in November. Since he returned to office in January, recorded aerial attacks from Moscow have reached their highest levels of the war. Throughout his campaign Trump vowed to bring an end to fighting in just one day if returned to office. He claimed during his 2024 campaign that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine could have been averted had a president who the Kremlin \"respected\" held office. However, in his efforts to achieve a ceasefire he has been accused at times of favouring Russia by critics, and his administration has paused deliveries of air defence munitions and other military supplies to Ukraine on two separate occasions. The pauses - announced in March and July and since reversed by the president - came as Russia steadily increased missile and drone production. According to Ukrainian military intelligence, ballistic missile construction in Russia grew by 66% over the past year. The data reviewed by BBC Verify - based on daily incident reports issued by the Ukrainian Air Force - showed that Russia launched 27,158 munitions between 20 January - when Trump's presidency began - and 19 July, compared with 11,614 over the final six months of Biden's term. \"This brutal war was brought on by Joe Biden's incompetence, and it has gone on for far too long,\" White House deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to BBC Verify. \"President Trump wants to stop the killing, which is why he is selling American-made weapons to Nato members and threatening Putin with biting tariffs and sanctions if he does not agree to a ceasefire.\" In the opening weeks of the new administration, the White House issued a series of warm statements seemingly intended to entice President Vladimir Putin towards a settlement. During this period, Russian attacks on Ukraine briefly fell when compared with the final weeks of the Biden administration. But by February, when US diplomats led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's delegation for a summit in Riyadh, attacks had started to climb again. The talks, which Rubio said were a starting point to bring an end to the war, have been followed by mediated discussions between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Turkey. Attacks peaked early last month, when Moscow launched 748 drones and missiles towards Ukraine on 9 July, according to the Ukrainian Air Force data. More than a dozen people were reportedly injured by the barrage and two were killed . While Trump has expressed anger at the escalating Russian attacks on several occasions, his mounting frustration does not appear to have had an impact on Moscow's strategy. On 25 May, Russia launched its then-largest recorded barrage, prompting Trump to angrily ask: \"What the hell happened to him [Putin]?\" Since then, Russia has exceeded that number of reported launches on 14 occasions. Trump has responded by demanding that the Kremlin reach a peace deal with Ukraine by 8 August . The number of Russian munitions penetrating Ukrainian air defences appears to be increasing, with explosions around the capital Kyiv becoming a daily part of life for residents of the city. \"Every time you go to sleep, you don't know if you're going to wake up the next morning, and that's just not a normal way to live,\" Dasha Volk, a journalist living in the city, told the BBC's Ukrainecast programme in June. \"Every time you hear an explosion or a missile flying over your head, lots of thoughts are going through my mind - I'm going to die now, things like that.\" Ukraine 'vulnerable' to aerial attacks Senator Chris Coons, a senior Democrat on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told BBC Verify that Trump's decision to suspend weapons supplies on two occasions and his broader approach to Russian relations may have convinced the Kremlin that it had the freedom to increase attacks. \"It's clear Putin feels emboldened by Trump's weakness and has increased his vicious assault on the Ukrainian people, repeatedly attacking hospitals and maternity wards, the Ukrainian power grid, and other civilian sites,\" he said. The growing attacks have renewed calls for the US to send fresh supplies of Patriot anti-air batteries to Ukraine. The Patriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m. Trump has overturned the previous supply pauses and agreed to sell weapons to Nato members, who will in turn supply them to Kyiv. Trum",

    "title": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott seeks court order to fire top Democrat who fled in row over voting map",
    "body": "Texas governor seeks court order to fire top Democrat who fled in row over voting map 4 hours ago Share Save Max Matza BBC News Share Save Watch: \"We have to use every tool\" - State lawmaker defends leaving Texas over gerrymandering Texas Governor Greg Abbott has said he is taking legal action to remove from office dozens of Democrats who have fled the state to block a plan to redraw electoral boundaries. He filed a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court seeking to fire Democratic legislator, Gene Wu, whom he called the \"ringleader\" of a plot to \"hijack\" state government. While the filing focuses on Wu, Abbott said in a statement that the departure of more than 50 Democrats would \"constitute abandonment of their office, justifying their removal\". The redrawn congressional map would create five more Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives in Washington DC, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Gerrymandering – redrawing electoral boundaries to favour a political party – has been a practice of both Democrats and Republicans nationwide over the years. But typically, states undergo redistricting every 10 years, when voting maps are redrawn to account for population changes noted in the US census. Texas last re-drew its congressional lines in 2021, just after the 2020 census, and wouldn't typically change those lines again until the next population count in five years. \"Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences,\" the governor said in a statement. At least two-thirds of the 150-member state legislative body in Texas must be present to proceed with the vote. The quorum became unreachable after the Democratic lawmakers fled the state at the weekend. How a Texas showdown could reshape Congress - and Trump's presidency \"The court's decision will determine if only one third of the Legislature can dictate the outcome for 100% of Texans,\" the lawsuit says. It argues: \"Most people who repeatedly fail to show up for work get fired. Public servants must be held to the same standard.\" The filing asks the state's highest court to grant a rarely used writ of quo warranto to oust Wu from his office. Quo warranto is a court action used to resolve a dispute over whether a specific person has the legal right to hold public office. The lawsuit came a day after the Republican governor ordered that the absent Democrats be arrested and returned to the statehouse so a vote on redistricting can go ahead. At a White House event on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the FBI \"may have to\" help Texas authorities in locating and arresting the lawmakers. \"I know they want them back, not only the attorney general ... the governor of Texas is demanding they come back. So, a lot of people are demanding they come back,\" Trump said. Wu, who is chairman of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, told the Texas Tribune that denying a quorum was \"not an abandonment of my office\", but \"a fulfillment of my oath\". He accused Abbott of seeking to \"silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office\", and argued \"my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant\". The lawsuit asks the Republican-dominated Texas Supreme Court to issue its ruling by 17:00 local time on Thursday – one day before the House session is scheduled to resume. Watch: Texas Democrats and Republicans at odds over redistricting vote All nine justices on the Texas Supreme Court are Republican, and the chief justice was formerly Abbott's general counsel. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is pursuing a separate action to have the Democrats' seats declared \"vacant\", said on Monday the legal process would possibly be long and drawn-out. Paxton told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson that to remove the lawmakers, separate lawsuits would need to be filed against each one in their individual counties. \"We'd have to go through a court process, and we'd have to file that maybe in districts that are not friendly to Republicans,\" Paxton said. \"So it's a challenge because every district would be different.\" Democrats have defended their decision to break quorum. Speaking to BBC News from Chicago, Texas Democrat Ana-María Rodríguez Ramos said: \"We have to use every tool at our disposal... to continue to protect our democracy.\" Watch: What is gerrymandering? We use gummy bears to explain Trump has urged on Texas Republicans in the redistricting process. He told CNBC on Tuesday: \"I got the highest vote [last year] in the history of Texas, as you probably know, and we are entitled to five more seats.\" Now Democrats nationwide are threatening to up the ante with tit-for-tat tactics, although they face legal hurdles. Democrats in California want to reshape their own district maps and shed five Republican seats, although voters would have to approve such a plan. Democrats in Wisconsin filed lawsuits last month seeking to redistrict. New York's Democratic Governor wants to redistrict, too, but doing so would require",

The implosion of the vessel was caused by the loss of structural integrity of its carbon fibre hull, exposing passengers to \"approximately 4,930 pounds per square inch of water pressure\", the report found. They died instantaneously. The tragedy was \"preventable\", it said. Investigators found âcritically flawedâ safety practices at the sub's owner OceanGate Expeditions, and said it used \"intimidation\ntactics\" for several years before the disaster to avoid scrutiny. Much of the blame goes to the Chief Executive\nStockton Rush, the US Coast Guard said. He was on board and also died in the disaster. The report found he \" exhibited\nnegligence that contributed to the deaths of four individuals\". The company failed to follow safety protocols . It was under financial pressure and had a \"toxic workplace environment\" , using the firing of senior staff and the \"looming threat\" of being fired to dissuade employees and contractors from expressing safety concerns, the report found. A lot of questions were answered in this investigation. But \"no report can alter the heart-breaking outcome,\" the family of two of the victims said.

Catalogue of failures : Officials said that before the tragedy, OceanGate had seriously flawed practices and did not follow established engineering protocols for safety, testing and maintenance of their submersible. The coast guard says this was the main reason for the deaths . CEO to blame : The report was especially critical of OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush - who died on board the sub - saying he ignored vital inspections, data analyses and preventive maintenance procedures . Mounting cash problems : The findings also reveal OceanGate was facing financial difficulties, with employees having to temporarily forgo salaries on the promise of back pay. Weak regulation : The report also highlighted a wider issue - the lack of domestic and international oversight for manned submersibles like Titan.

Luhn, who has worked for multiple news outlets including the BBC, departed for his hike from the town of Odda on 31 July, according to his wife Veronika Silchenko. He did not show up for his return flight to take him home on Monday, leading her to call authorities. Rescue operations are continuing, although officials say they are being hampered by poor weather that is preventing helicopters from flying patrols. Rescue crews are using dogs and drones to conduct the search, the New York Times reported, citing Ingeborg Thorsland, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Red Cross. His wife said that he is an experienced outdoorsman who has previously camped in poor weather conditions. \"Alec is basically obsessed with the Arctic,\" Ms Silchenko told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. \"He loves glaciers and snow, and he loves explorers,\" she said, adding that as a climate journalist, he is attempting to visit glaciers that are rapidly shrinking due to climate change. \"He's trying his best to go to the coldest countries,\" she said. Mr Luhn, 38, is currently based in London, but has recently lived in Moscow and Istanbul, according to CNN. He has previously reported for numerous outlets, including The Atlantic, National Geographic, The New York Times, Scientific American, Time magazine, and CBS. Last year, he wrote for the BBC about Canada's \"zombie\" fires, which burn year round and are believed to be growing more common.

    "body": "RFK Jr cancels $500m in mRNA vaccine development in the US 5 hours ago Share Save Madeline Halpert BBC News Share Save Getty Images The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) plans to cancel $500m (£376m) in funding for mRNA vaccines being developed to counter viruses like the flu and Covid-19. The move will impact 22 projects being led by major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, for vaccines against bird flu and other viruses, HHS said. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, announced he was pulling the funding over claims that \"mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses\". Doctors and health experts have criticised Kennedy's longstanding questioning of the safety and efficacy of vaccines and his views on health policies. The development of mRNA vaccines to target Covid-19 was critical in helping slow down the pandemic and saving millions of lives, said Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official. He told the BBC that the change was the US \"turning its back on one of the most promising tools to fight the next pandemic\". In a statement, Kennedy said his team had \"reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted\". \"[T]he data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu,\" he said. He said the department was shifting the funding toward \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate\". Kennedy also claimed that mRNA vaccines can help \"encourage new mutations and can actually prolong pandemics as the virus constantly mutates to escape the protective effects of the vaccine\". Health experts have said that viruses mutate regardless of whether vaccines exist for them. Dr Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted the flu virus mutates every year regardless of whether people get vaccinated, while the measles virus has not mutated, despite the majority of people being vaccinated with an mRNA shot. He said mRNA vaccines are \"remarkably safe\" and a key to helping prevent against severe infections from viruses like Covid-19. HHS said the department that runs the vaccine projects, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), would focus on \"platforms with stronger safety records and transparent clinical and manufacturing data practices\". While some vaccines use an inactivated virus to trigger an immune response, mRNA vaccines work by teaching cells how to make proteins that can trigger an immune response. Moderna and Pfizer's mRNA vaccines were tested in thousands of people before being rolled out and were found to be safe and effective. Dr Offit, who invented the rotavirus vaccine, said the funding cancellation could put the US in a \"more dangerous\" position to respond to any potential future pandemic. He noted mRNA vaccines have a shorter development cycle, which is why they were crucial to responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. Since taking office, Kennedy has taken a number of steps to transform how the nation's health department develops and regulates vaccines. In June, he fired all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on immunisations, replacing them with some people who have criticized the safety and efficacy of vaccines. He also removed the Covid-19 vaccine from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women.

Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba attended the ceremony on Wednesday, along with officials from around the world and the city's mayor Kazumi Matsui. Matsui warned of a global \"accelerating trend toward military build-up... [and] the idea that nuclear weapons are essential for national defence\", saying this was a \"flagrant disregard [of] the lessons the international community should have learned from the tragedies of history\". World War Two ended with Japan's surrender after the dropping of the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombs killed more than 200,000 people - some from the immediate blast and others from radiation sickness and burns. The legacy of the weapons continues to haunt survivors today. \"My father was badly burned and blinded by the blast. His skin was hanging from his body - he couldn't even hold my hand,\" Hiroshima survivor Shingo Naito told the BBC. He was six years old when the bomb struck his city, killing his father and two younger siblings. Mr Naito has been sharing his story with a group of students in Hiroshima, who are turning his memories of the tragedy into art. Watch: 'Hiroshima survivor stories were painful to draw' In 2024, Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese group of atomic bomb survivors won the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons. In a speech on Wednesday, mayor Matsui said that the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,  which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, was \"on the brink of dysfunctionality\". He also called on the Japanese government to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons - an international agreement banning nuclear weapons that came into force in 2021. Getty Images The legacy of the atomic bomb lingers in Japan today More than 70 countries have ratified the treaty, but nuclear powers like the US and Russia have opposed it, pointing to the deterrence function of nuclear arsenals. Japan has also rejected such a ban, arguing that its security is enhanced by US nuclear weapons. The nuclear issue is a divisive one in Japan. On the streets leading up to the Peace Memorial Park, there were small protests calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Satoshi Tanaka, another atomic bomb survivor who suffered multiple cancers from radiation exposure, said that seeing the bloodshed in Gaza and Ukraine today conjures up his own suffering. \"Seeing the mountains of rubble, the destroyed cities, the children and women fleeing in panic, it all brings back memories of what I went through,\" he told the BBC. \"We are living alongside nuclear weapons that could wipe out humanity multiple times over.\" \"The most urgent priority is to push the leaders of nuclear-armed countries.

    "body": "Former Romanian President Ion Iliescu dies aged 95 14 hours ago Share Save Mircea Barbu BBC News in Bucharest James Gregory BBC News Share Save Getty Images Ion Iliescu pictured in 1996 Former Romanian President Ion Iliescu, who presided over the country's chaotic transition from communism to democracy, has died aged 95. Iliescu had been diagnosed with lung cancer and hospitalised in early June in Romania's capital, Bucharest. \"It is with deep regret that the government announces the passing of the former President of Romania, Mr Ion Iliescu,\" a government statement said. Iliescu was Romania's first freely elected president, and served twice, between 1990-1996 and 2000-2004. He was accused of crimes against humanity over the violent revolt that toppled Romania's communist regime in 1989, but always denied wrongdoing. Born in 1930, in the southern city of Oltenita, Iliescu studied engineering in Russia, and later returned to Romania, where he joined the Communist Party. He left politics in 1980 but re-emerged nine years later, during the revolution. Following his election as president in 1990 with the Social Democratic Party, he was re-elected for a four-year term but then defeated in 1996. He returned to power in 2000 for a third and final term, during which Romania joined Nato and launched its bid for EU membership. Obituary: Romania's first democratic leader with a divisive legacy Iliescu had largely withdrawn from public life in recent years, during which he faced charges of crimes against humanity but was never convicted. Prosecutors in 2018 formally indicted Iliescu over his role in the 1989 revolution, during which he rose to power. More than 1,000 people were killed during the revolt, and prosecutors alleged that Iliescu - who had taken control of the military - failed to prevent \"numerous situations\" where people were needlessly killed. He was also accused of spreading misinformation through the media that caused panic. The charges were ultimately dropped. In a separate case, he was also charged over his role in calling in miners to crush student protests after his election in 1990. Several people died and around 1,000 others were wounded in the bloody crackdown, which became known as the Mineriad and drew widespread international condemnation. That case was also dropped. AFP via Getty Images More than 1,100 people were killed during Romania's 1989 revolution Iliescu's death on Tuesday prompted his political allies and rivals to reflect on the complex and often contentious legacy he leaves behind. Romania's current President Nicusor Dan said that \"history will judge\" Iliescu, whom he called \"the central character of the 90s transition\". \"It is our responsibility to clarify the major unresolved cases of that era, in order to move forward with full awareness,\" Dan added, ending his message with \"may God forgive him\". Former Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, said the country had lost \"one of the most influential personalities in its recent history\". \"Ion Iliescu, an emblematic leader of Romanian social democracy, was a defining figure in our country's transition to democratic and European values after the 1989 Revolution.\" Sorin Grindeanu, the current leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), said that Iliescu \"remains the social-democratic leader who fundamentally shaped the party's development – a politician who showed deep empathy for those in difficulty\". \"Regardless of divergent views, his contribution to Romania's transition to democracy remains part of our collective memory.\" AFP via Getty Images Romania joined Nato and launched its bid for EU membership during Iliescu's final term as Romania's president Iliescu's health had declined in recent years. Prior to his latest hospitalisation, he had been receiving regular medical check-ups at Elias Hospital in Bucharest. In 2019, he underwent surgery for pericardial effusion - a condition affecting the heart. He had no children and is survived by his wife, Nina Serbanescu. His state funeral will take place over two days, on 6 and 7 August. During this, his body will lie in state in Bucharest so the public can pay their respects. A military funeral service will then be held for him at the Ghencea Military Cemetery.

    "title": "Great Barrier Reef suffers worst coral decline on record",
    "body": "Great Barrier Reef suffers worst coral decline on record 5 hours ago Share Save Tom McArthur BBC News Share Save Getty Images Parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered the largest annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly 40 years ago, according to a new report. Northern and southern branches of the sprawling Australian reef both suffered their most widespread coral bleaching, the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) found. Reefs have been battered in recent months by tropical cyclones and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish that feast on coral, but heat stress driven by climate change is the predominant reason, AIMS said. AIMS warns the habitat may reach a tipping point where coral cannot recover fast enough between catastrophic events and faces a \"volatile\" future. The 'underwater bushfire' cooking Australia's reefs A really simple guide to climate change AIMS surveyed the health of 124 coral reefs between August 2024 and May 2025. It has been performing surveys since 1986. Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 2,300km (1,429-mile) expanse of tropical corals that houses a stunning array of biodiversity. Repeated bleaching events are turning vast swaths of once-vibrant coral white. Australia's second largest reef, Ningaloo – on Australia's western coast – has also experienced repeated bleaching, and this year both major reefs simultaneously turned white for the first time ever. Coral is vital to the planet. Nicknamed the sea's architect, it builds vast structures that house an estimated 25% of all marine species. Bleaching happens when coral gets stressed and turns white because the water it lives in is too hot. Getty Images Coral can recover from heat stress but it needs time - ideally several years Stressed coral will probably die if it experiences temperatures 1C (1.8F) above its thermal limit for two months. If waters are 2C higher, it can survive around one month. Unusually warm tropical waters triggered widespread coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 2024 and in the first few months of 2025, the sixth such event since 2016. As well as climate change, natural weather patterns like El Niño can also play a role in mass bleaching events. The reef has \"experienced unprecedented levels of heat stress, which caused the most spatially extensive and severe bleaching recorded to date,\" the report found. Any recovery could take years and was dependent on future coral reproduction and minimal environmental disturbance, according to the report. In the latest AIMS survey results, the most affected coral species were the Acropora, which are susceptible to heat stress and a favoured food of the crown-of-thorns starfish. \"These corals are the fastest to grow and are the first to go,\" AIMS research lead Dr Mike Emslie told ABC News. \"The Great Barrier Reef is such a beautiful, iconic place, it's really, really worth fighting for. And if we can give it a chance, it's shown an inherent ability to recover,\" he said. There has been some success with the Australian government's crown-of-thorns starfish culling programme, which has killed over 50,000 starfish by injecting them with vinegar or ox bile. \"Due to crown-of-thorns starfish control activities, there were no potential, established, or severe outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2025,\" the AIMS report noted. The creatures are native to the Great Barrier Reef and are capable of eating vast amounts of coral. But since the 1960s their numbers have increased significantly, with nutrients from land-based agriculture run-off regarded as the most likely cause. Richard Leck from the global environmental charity WWF said the report shows that the reef is an \"ecosystem under incredible stress\" and scientists are concerned about what happens when \"the reef does not keep bouncing back the way it has,\" he told news agency AFP. Leck said some coral reefs around the world are already beyond recovery, warning the Great Barrier Reef could suffer the same fate without ambitious and rapid climate action. The Great Barrier Reef has been heritage-listed for over 40 years, but Unesco warns the Australian icon is \"in danger\" from warming seas and pollution.

    "title": "Bill and Hillary Clinton subpoenaed in congressional Epstein probe",
    "body": "Clintons subpoenaed to testify in congressional Epstein investigation 4 hours ago Share Save Ben Hatton and Kayla Epstein BBC News Share Save Getty Images Bill and Hillary Clinton appear onstage together at an event. Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary are among high-profile figures to be sent legal summonses from a congressional committee investigating the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Republican James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, issued the subpoenas to the Clintons and eight other individuals. The committee is seeking information about Epstein's history, after President Donald Trump's administration decided against releasing more federal files on the dead financier. That decision sparked outrage among Trump supporters and some Democrats, who refused to accept the justice department's statement that there was no \"incriminating client list\" in the Epstein files. Amid a rift between Trump and some of his supporters on Epstein, the committee, made up of both Democrats and Republicans, recently voted to issue the subpoenas. The panel has also subpoenaed the justice department itself for records related to Epstein. Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, had indicated she was willing to testify before the powerful investigatory committee, with strict legal protections. Her scheduled 11 August deposition, though, has been postponed indefinitely. The Epstein legal saga has spanned two decades, with Florida police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation first scrutinising the well-connected tycoon for allegations of sexual abuse in the early 2000s. Comer wrote in letters to each person that the committee must \"conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr Epstein\" and Maxwell. He also indicated that depositions will start this month and run through the autumn, with Bill Clinton scheduled for 14 October. Former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and Alberto Gonzales were summoned, along with Jeff Sessions and William Barr, who both led the justice department during Trump's first term. Former FBI Sirectors James Comey and Robert Mueller were also sent subpoenas. The Clinton administration predates the Epstein investigation, but the couple's critics have long questioned their relationship with Epstein. A spokesperson has acknowledged that Bill Clinton took four trips with staff on Epstein's private plane in 2002 and 2003, and met with Epstein in New York in 2002. Clinton also visited Epstein's New York apartment around that time. The letters to each Clinton cites these incidents, as well as other alleged encounters and connections, as reasons for summoning them. Citing flight logs, US media have previously reported Clinton flew on Epstein's jet up to 26 times, occasionally without his Secret Service detail. In 2019, a spokesman said the former president \"knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.\" The Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Department of Justice had no comment. Getty Images Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein abuse girls The committee is seeking all of the department's documents and communications on Epstein and Maxwell \"relating or referring to human trafficking, exploitation of minors, sexual abuse, or related activity\", as well as files from the US criminal cases against Maxwell and Epstein, documents from a 2007 agreement to not prosecute Epstein and federal investigations into the former financier. It is not immediately clear if individuals named by Comer will appear before the committee and, if they do, whether they will testify publicly. Over the last 200 years, only four other former presidents have received subpoenas from congressional committees, and only two provided testimony. Notably, the committee investigating the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot voted during a televised hearing to subpoena Trump, who then sued to stop it. The subpoena was dropped when the committee disbanded. Federal prosecutors charged Epstein with sex trafficking of minors and other crimes in 2019, during the first Trump administration. He died by suicide in jail that August, and almost immediately afterwards many began questioning the circumstances of his death. This summer,  Attorney General Pam Bondi announced her department, after conducting a review, had found no evidence of the long-rumoured client list . She also said evidence supported that Epstein died by suicide. The government would release no more files, she said. The announcements sparked outrage among some supporters of Trump, who promised in his campaign to release Epstein records",

    "title": "Zelensky thanks Trump for 'productive' talks ahead of ceasefire deadline",
    "body": "Zelensky thanks Trump for 'productive' talks ahead of ceasefire deadline 12 hours ago Share Save Laura Gozzi BBC News Share Save Getty Images Zelensky said he and Trump had talked about the \"increased brutality\" of Russian strikes on Ukraine Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has said he and Donald Trump discussed sanctions against Russia, defence cooperation and drone production ahead of a visit to Moscow by US envoy Steve Witkoff. Thanking Trump for \"productive\" talks on Tuesday, Zelensky claimed that Moscow was particularly \"sensitive\" to the prospect of sanctions. Trump has previously stated that if Russia fails to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine by Friday it will face hefty sanctions or see secondary sanctions imposed against all those who trade with it. Witkoff will be in Moscow on Wednesday and is expected to meet Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has mostly skirted Trump's sanctions threat, though spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted last week that the Russian economy had \"developed a certain immunity\" to sanctions due to being under them for so long. Trump has also admitted that he did not know whether sanctions \"bothered\" Putin. The US president may be hoping that Russia's trading partners will be sufficiently inconvenienced by the tariffs that they will choose to pivot away from buying Moscow's oil - ultimately making a dent in the revenue the Kremlin needs to continue waging its war on Ukraine. On Monday Trump said he would impose hefty new tariffs on India , a major buyer of Russian oil, accusing it of not caring \"how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine\". The Kremlin said \"attemps to force countries to cut trade relations with Russia\" were \"illegal\". In his Telegram post Zelensky said he and Trump had also talked about the \"increased brutality\" of Russian strikes on Ukraine. The US president has previously referenced Moscow's repeated attacks on Ukrainian cities, signalling irritation that the bombings often follow \"nice\" phone conversations between himself and Putin. Only last February Zelensky was asked to leave the White House after a disastrous meeting in which the US president accused him of not being thankful enough for US aid and of \"gambling with World War Three\". The two men have gradually repaired their relationship. In July Trump said the US would sell \"top-of-the-line weapons\" to Nato members which would then pass them on to Kyiv - and this week it was announced that Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden would be the first countries to buy weapons from the US under this scheme. Their combined contributions will amount to more than $1bn and will go towards air defence equipment and ammunition. Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said speed was \"absolutely critical\" and that Denmark would be willing to consider additional funding later. More than three years on from Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian cities continue to come under heavy bombardment and regular drone attacks. Over the last day six people were killed across eastern Ukraine, authorities said. Before taking office Trump repeatedly said he would be able to end the conflict within a day - and it was at his behest that Russia and Ukraine sat down for ceasefire talks for the first time last May. But the discussions failed to bring the two sides any closer to peace and the US president has appeared increasingly impatient with the lack of progress. Despite Trump’s looming deadline, Vladimir Putin last week poured cold water on any hopes of a swift, long-term ceasefire with Ukraine. Although he said he viewed talks with Kyiv \"positively,\" he also noted that \"all disappointments arise from inflated expectations\".

    "body": "Besieged Sudan city residents face starvation, UN warns 17 hours ago Share Save Barbara Plett Usher Africa correspondent, BBC News Share Save AFP/Getty Images Sudan's civil war - into its third year - has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises The UN's food agency has warned that families trapped within the besieged Sudanese city of el-Fasher face starvation. The World Food Programme (WFP) said it had not been able to deliver food to the city in the western Darfur region by road for more than a year. El-Fasher has been surrounded by paramilitary fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for nearly 16 months - determined to seize it from Sudan's army. The WFP warning comes as local activists have already begun reporting deaths by starvation in the city, which is still home to about 300,000 people. Sudan was plunged into a civil war in April 2023 after a vicious power struggle erupted between the army and its former ally, the RSF - creating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The UN's children's agency (Unicef) has also issued a statement saying malnutrition is rife across the country, with many children \"reduced to skin and bones\". Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happening Sudan in danger of self-destructing as conflict and famine reign Sudanese eating charcoal and leaves to survive, aid agency warns The WFP warning echoes a recent appeal for urgent support from the North Darfur Governor Al-Hafiz Bakhit, who said the living situation in el-Fasher had become unbearable. Bakhit is aligned with Sudan's military-led government, which is trying to retain control of the city, its last foothold in Darfur. The RSF's battle to seize el-Fasher from the Sudanese army has intensified in recent months , after the paramilitaries were driven out of the capital, Khartoum. UN statistics in early July showed that 38% of children under the age of five in camps for internally displaced people within and near el-Fasher suffered from acute malnutrition. The WFP said severe food shortages had drastically driven up prices for scarce supplies in el-Fasher, and cited reports that people were eating animal fodder and food waste to try to survive. The agency did not name the party responsible - but the RSF has cut trade routes and blocked supply lines to the city. \"Everyone in el-Fasher is facing a daily struggle to survive,\" said Eric Perdison, WFP's regional director for eastern and southern Africa. \"People's coping mechanisms have been completely exhausted by over two years of war. Without immediate and sustained access, lives will be lost,\" he added. The agency quoted an eight-year-old girl, Sondos, who had fled the city with five family members. \"In el-Fasher there was a lot of shelling and hunger. Only hunger and bombs,\" the girl said, adding that the family had been surviving on only millet. The WFP said it had trucks loaded with food and nutrition assistance ready to go, and had received clearance from the Sudanese government to proceed to el-Fasher. It is still waiting for word from the RSF on whether it would support a pause in fighting to allow the goods into the city. The UN has been pushing for a week-long humanitarian truce since early June, when a UN convoy on the way to el-Fasher was attacked - with the army and the RSF blaming each other for the strike. Sudan's state news agency reported that head of the armed forces Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan - the country's de facto leader - had agreed to the temporary ceasefire. The RSF did not officially respond. However, reports quoting RSF advisers said the group had rejected the initiative as it believed the truce would be used to facilitate the delivery of food and ammunition to \"Burhan's besieged militias\" inside el-Fasher. They also claimed the RSF and its allies were setting up \"safe routes\" for civilians to leave the city. Last month the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said more than one million people had fled el-Fasher since the conflict began, including those from the nearby Zamzam camp that was seized by the RSF in April . The BBC has heard first-hand accounts of their desperate flight from intensified bombing of el-Fasher, and attacks by RSF-allied gangs on the road. The WFP said it had made modest progress in delivering food assistance to some other parts of Darfur, but said those fragile gains risked being reversed when roads were closed by the coming rainy season. Unicef's Sudan representative Sheldon Yett also said some conditions were slowly improving in areas of central Sudan, which had recently become accessible to aid workers after the Sudanese army drove out RSF fighters. But he said resources were stretched to the limit because of recent funding cuts, apparently referring to US President Donald Trump administration's drastic decrease in international aid. \"It is a looming catastrophe,\" he said. \"We are on the verge of irreversible damage to an entire generation of children, not because we lack the knowledge or th",

    "body": "Propaganda or fair warning? Taiwanese TV show imagines Chinese invasion 8 hours ago Share Save Tessa Wong BBC News, Asia Digital Reporter Share Save Watch: Taiwanese TV show explores Chinese invasion scenario A Chinese fighter jet plane crashes in the waters off Taiwan's coast, prompting Chinese warships to blockade the island for a \"search and rescue\". Taiwanese soldiers manning Dadan Island, a rocky outcrop mere kilometres from China's coast, begin vanishing mysteriously. Then one night, a fishing boat lands on Dadan. A signal flare arcs into the inky sky – and illuminates Chinese soldiers who have spilled out of the boat and amassed on the beach. This is the key scenario in Zero Day Attack, a new Taiwanese television show about a fictional Chinese military invasion. Beijing has long viewed self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory, vowing to \"reunify\" with it some day while not ruling out the use of force. The series, which aired its first episode over the weekend, was partially funded by the Taiwanese government, which hopes to raise awareness about the threat China poses. But the show has also landed at a highly divisive moment in Taiwan and attracted criticism of fear-mongering. Zero Day Attack focuses on how various parts of Taiwanese society grapple with the invasion, from the president to rural villagers. The anthology series features several scenarios on how an invasion could unfold, provided by defence experts consulted by the production team. These include the disruption of Taiwan's communication lines; Chinese disinformation campaigns; \"fifth column\" supporters of China stirring up unrest; and military officials turned collaborators who conspire against Taiwan. Showrunner Chen Hsin-mei told the BBC she wanted to make the series to \"warn the Taiwanese people that the war is really coming,\" citing China's rising use of \"disinformation campaigns and grey zone warfare to put our society in chaos and make us confused about our identity\". Zeroday Cultural and Creative The show depicts \"fifth column\" Chinese sympathisers stirring up unrest in Taiwan Zero Day Attack's message echoes the rhetoric of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government and its leader President William Lai, who have warned about China's threat and preached the need to raise the island's defences. Taiwan's culture ministry has partially funded Zero Day Attack, while the military provided support for filming and production. Chunghwa Telecoms, Taiwan's largest telecommunications company in which the government has a minority stake, also contributed funding. Other private investors include billionaire Robert Tsao, a well-known supporter of Taiwanese independence who has funded civil defence efforts . Ms Chen told the BBC that at no point did the authorities try to influence the show. She also said she was not a member of the DPP or any political party. But even before a single episode was broadcast, Zero Day Attack has become a political lightning rod, given the charged topic. 'Selling dried mangoes' A 17-minute trailer posted online last year by the production team swiftly racked up hundreds of thousands of views and comments. While some praised it for its message, others criticised it for sowing anxiety and discord with China. This debate has intensified with the series premiere, which was the most-watched show on several platforms on Saturday, according to the production company. In recent days Wang Hung-wei, a prominent lawmaker from the opposition Kuomintang party, criticised Zero Day Attack as \"selling dried mangoes\", a Taiwanese euphemism that means stoking unnecessary fear about the destruction of one's country. Pointing to the government's funding of the show, Ms Wang said the DPP was \"using the state apparatus to achieve its political goals\". A commentary by Wang Kunyi of the Taiwan International Strategic Study Society accused the show of pushing Taiwan independence \"so that Taiwan becomes a place that never knows peace\". He added that it was evidence of Lai's government \"once again using all kinds of channels to play the 'anti-Communist card' and stir up anxiety of war\". The DPP and Lai are often accused by their critics, including the opposition and China, as pushing for Taiwan's independence. Any formal declaration as such would be considered as an act of war by Beijing. While Lai has in the past described himself as a \"pragmatic worker for Taiwan's independence\", he has also insisted Taiwan has no need to formally declare independence because it is already a sovereign nation. Getty Images Taiwan's President William Lai on a recent visit to a military base Zero Day Attack has also garnered positive reviews. One published by the public broadcaster PTS said it \"expresses the worries and anxieties of Taiwanese from various political camps in a highly realistic and reasonable way\". \"It's a good watch,\" said one commenter on Zero Day Attack's Facebook page. \"The Taiwanese people can relate to it as it reflec",

    "body": "Stay or go? Under Trump, dreams fade for Chinese who trekked to US 7 hours ago Share Save Shawn Yuan Global China Unit, BBC World Service Reporting from California, US Share Save BBC Pan, a man in his fifties from China, now works at a Chinese restaurant in Barstow, California, after having come to the US by way of Latin America two years ago When Pan decided to leave his homeland in early 2023, he did so with a conviction that his future no longer belonged there. As he headed to America, he dreamed of a freer society, a fairer economy, and a life lived with dignity – things he said he could never claim in China, where his home had been forcibly demolished by the local government to make way for real estate development. To chase that dream, he embarked on a journey of thousands of miles from China to Ecuador in 2023, from which point he trekked jungles as part of his long route. About two months later, he finally made it to the US. Pan, a soft-spoken man in his late 50s from a small village in Jiangxi province in eastern China, is one of tens of thousands of Chinese nationals who have made the same journey in recent years. Known colloquially as zou xian ke, or \"those who walked the line\", they represent a new wave of migration driven by authoritarian tightening at home and the belief – sometimes naive, often desperate – that the US still offers a fair shot at a better life. Their reasons for exodus varied, but their experiences once on American soil follow certain trends: many have ended up isolated by language, burdened by debt and surviving on gig work as they wait for their asylum claims to crawl through an overwhelming immigration system. Some remain hopeful. Others are unravelling. And all of them, now, are living in the long shadow of President Donald Trump's political return - during which the poor US-China relations of recent years have soured even further. Fatman Ding Plaza, sitting in the centre of Monterey Park, a city outside of Los Angeles, is the \"ground zero\" of Chinese migrants who came to the US 'Hard work here brings hope' Pan is one of several Chinese migrants who I first met two years ago. Like many of the group who he travelled with, he now works in a Chinese restaurant, even though back home, he prided himself on his farming know-how. In America, those skills don't translate, since the soil conditions are different and he doesn't speak English. Past lives hold little currency. For a while after arriving, Pan wandered from city to city, sleeping on borrowed couches or bunking with fellow migrants. Eventually, he landed in Barstow, California, a dusty industrial town. His life today is penned within a tight radius. He cooks and sometimes waits tables at a restaurant during the day, video-calls his wife and children in China at night, and repeats the routine the next day. He lives in a room attached to the kitchen. To outsiders, and even to his family back home, Pan's life might seem unbearably monotonous. But to him, it's defined not by what's lacking, but by what's no longer present. No land seizures. No meddling officials. No fear of arbitrary punishment. \"My family doesn't understand,\" he said with a half-smile. \"They ask why I left a comfortable life behind. But here, even if it's simple, it's mine. It's free.\" Pan's sense of freedom is quiet but stubborn. Two years ago, in a cramped hotel room in Quito, Ecuador, he told me on the eve of his journey that even if he died en route, it would be worth it. He still says the same. \"All of this,\" he repeated, \"is worth it.\" Like many newcomers, Pan doesn't have any meaningful social circle – the mounting language and cultural difference challenges confine his life to interactions with fellow migrants. Occasionally, he travels to Los Angeles to join protests outside the Chinese consulate. He admits that is partly to strengthen his asylum claim by establishing a public record of political dissent. But it is also because, after decades of silence, he can. On 4 June, the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre – a date scrubbed from China's public memory by the authorities – he stood again outside the consulate chanting anti-Chinese Communist Party slogans. That day, among the familiar crowd, he spotted James. A young man in his early 30s who hailed from western China, James had travelled with Pan from Ecuador through the Darién Gap and up to the US border. But if Pan's story is one of quiet stoicism, James's is more kinetic, more restless. After his release from a US immigration detention centre, James bounced between cash gigs in Monterey Park, a Chinese-majority suburb east of Los Angeles. He ultimately bought a cargo van, drove out to Palm Springs, and made the car both his livelihood and his home. The van is cluttered with sleeping bags, gas canisters, and a portable charger - that's all he needs to be content with his life. During the day, he delivers food around the city; at night, he parks outside a 24-hour gym and sleeps with the ",

    "body": "How Trump's secondary tariffs on Russia could hit the global economy 7 hours ago Share Save Jonathan Josephs Business reporter, BBC News • jonathanjosephs Share Save Getty Images \"I used trade for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars\", President Trump has said Despite being the world's most sanctioned country, Russia has continued to use its vast energy wealth to bankroll its war in Ukraine. US President Donald Trump is hoping to change that. He has announced that  sweeping new secondary tariffs will impact any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday 8 August. Secondary tariffs would see goods from any country  that trades with Russia face a 100% tax when they are imported into the US. Oil and gas are Russia's biggest exports, and Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey. \"I used trade for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars\", said Trump last month. This would not be the first time the Trump administration has imposed secondary tariffs, which are also in place to punish buyers of Venezuelan oil. However, using them against Russia would have far bigger implications for the global economy. Russia remains the world's third biggest oil producer, behind only Saudi Arabia and the US itself. But its shipments have been falling this year, according to a Bloomberg analysis of ship-tracking data. Bloomberg Russia's vast energy industry has helped bankroll its invasion of Ukraine Increased energy prices \"The key channel by which secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian energy could impact the global economy would be through the level of energy prices,\" says Kieran Tompkins from the consultancy Capital Economics. If the tariffs work, they will cut the flow of Russian oil and gas to global markets. And with less supply, prices could go up, just as they did when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. That led to a spike in inflation around the world. President Trump says he isn't worried because of record US oil production. Mr Tompkins points out that, this time, there are also other reasons to suggest the impact on prices would not be as marked. He explains that \"the current backdrop is one where OPEC+ [the group of major oil producing countries and its allies] have significant spare capacity to draw upon.\" Russia has devised a whole system for avoiding existing sanctions, which could be useful for helping its trading partners avoid the secondary tariffs threatened by Trump. For example, its so-called \"shadow fleet\" - consisting of hundreds of tankers with obscure ownership - could be used to conceal the origin of exported Russian oil and gas. \"Sanctions maintenance is as big a task as the imposition of sanctions in the first place,\" US sanctions expert Richard Nephew of Columbia University says. \"That's because the party that is being sanctioned takes steps to evade them.\" Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images \"The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,\" the country's foreign ministry said Pricier iPhones from India Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 India has been the second biggest buyer of Russian oil, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air . \"They're fuelling the war machine. And if they're going to do that, then I'm not going to be happy,\" President Trump told US outlet CNBC on Tuesday. If secondary sanctions take effect, US companies buying goods from India will have to pay a 100% import tax - or tariff - when those products reach US shores. The idea is that it makes these goods so expensive that US businesses will choose to buy them cheaper from elsewhere, resulting in lost revenue for India. That, in turn, is supposed to deter India from buying Russian oil. And if Russia is left unable to sell its oil elsewhere because other countries face the same predicament, it will have less cash to finance the war in Ukraine. One way in which Americans could experience higher prices as a result of new secondary tariffs is in their purchase of mobile phones from India. India calls Trump's tariff threat over Russian oil 'unjustified' US firm Apple is moving much of its iPhone production to India - in particular the manufacturing of handsets that it wants to sell in the US. If these products are subject to the new tariffs, prices could double for US consumers. That is because tariffs are paid by the companies that import goods - and those companies tend to pass most, if not all, of their cost increases on to their customers. Imports to the US from India are already facing a 25% tariff as part of President Trump's broader trade shake-up, and he told CNBC that number could be raised \"very substantially\". India's government has accused the US of double standards, pointing to Washington's own continued trade with Russia. The vast majority of that trade is made up of US imports from India which amounted to just over $3bn (£2.2bn) last year - although that'",

    "body": "Ion Iliescu: Romania's first democratic leader with a divisive legacy 10 hours ago Share Save Mircea Barbu BBC News in Bucharest Share Save Peter Turnley/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images Iliescu at Romania's presidential palace in 1993, during his first of three terms in office Ion Iliescu, a figure whose name is intertwined with the tumultuous birth of modern Romania, has died at the age of 95. A career politician who shaped the country's transition from communism to democracy, he was both a beacon of hope and a deeply divisive presence in Romanian politics. His death on 5 August marks the end of a life spent at the heart of some of Romania's most dramatic and contentious moments. \"To understand Iliescu, you must grasp the complexity of Romania's 1990s,\" says political analyst Teodor Tita. \"He was neither a simple hero, nor a straightforward villain. He embodied the contradictions of a country struggling to reinvent itself while haunted by its past.\" Iliescu rose to prominence amid the chaos of the December 1989 revolution, when decades of Nicolae Ceausescu's oppressive rule came to an abrupt and violent end. Initially hailed as the man who would lead Romania into a new democratic era, Iliescu's legacy soon became more complicated. Former Romanian President Ion Iliescu dies aged 95 His leadership steered the nation through its fragile early years of democracy and towards eventual integration with Nato and the European Union, achievements that many credit to his steady hand. Yet, as Teodor Tita explains: \"His presidency was also marked by moments that still scar Romania's collective memory - the suppression of protests in 1990, the violent Mineriads, and his apparent reluctance to fully break with the old communist structures. These events have left a shadow that lingers.\" Georges Merillon/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Iliescu addresses thousands of people during his campaign in May 1990 Born on 3 March 1930 in the Danube town of Oltenita, Iliescu studied engineering in Moscow, Russia, during the Stalin era, where he became active in Romanian student political circles. His time in the Soviet Union would later fuel speculation – never proven – that he had ties with high-ranking communist figures, including Mikhail Gorbachev. After returning to Romania, Iliescu rose rapidly within the Communist Party, holding positions in propaganda and youth policy. But his reformist leanings eventually made him a target for Ceausescu, who marginalised him from the party's upper ranks. By the 1980s, Iliescu was out of politics and working as a director at a government-affiliated academic publishing house. His re-emergence during the 1989 revolution, which lasted from 16-25 December and saw more than 1,000 people killed, was seen by some as opportunistic, but to others, it was a stabilising presence amid chaos. As leader of the National Salvation Front (FSN), a political organisation that formed during the revolution, Iliescu became Romania's interim president and oversaw the rapid dismantling of Ceausescu's regime. On Christmas Day, Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad after a trial at a military base that lasted two hours. Watch: The fall of the Ceaușescus - when Romania stood up to tyranny In 1990, he won Romania's first democratic election in more than 50 years with a staggering 85% of the vote. But the campaign was marred by disinformation and state-aligned propaganda against liberal rivals. Later that year, Iliescu faced growing protests from students and opposition supporters. His now-infamous call for miners to descend on the capital to \"restore order\" led to days of brutal street violence known as the Mineriads, during which dozens were injured and several killed. He served another full term after winning the 1992 elections, then returned for a final presidency between 2000 and 2004. Turbulent years followed the revolution. Deep-rooted and insidious influential figures, dating back to the communist era persisted, and Iliescu's presidency was marked by widespread corruption. Critics argue that his reluctance to fully reform the justice system or confront the legacy of the Securitate – the feared secret police – allowed a culture of impunity to take root. More than three decades on from the revolution, Romania still struggles with political corruption and remains one of the poorest and most corrupt members of the European Union – a reality that some trace back to Iliescu's rule. His later years in office saw progress on Romania's Western integration – including Nato membership and the closing of EU accession talks. There were also market reforms, allowing small businesses to open, and Romania adopted its first democratic constitution in 1991, which still shapes the country today. But Iliescu remained dogged by questions over his role in the bloodshed of the early 1990s. In 2017, he was formally indicted for crimes against humanity in connection with both the 1989 revolution and the 1990 Mineriads. The",

    "title": "A Texas showdown could reshape Congress - and Trump's presidency",
    "body": "How a Texas showdown could reshape Congress - and Trump's presidency 11 hours ago Share Save Anthony Zurcher North America correspondent Share Save Watch: Texas Speaker plans civil arrest warrants against absent Democrats Dozens of Texas Democrats have secretly left the state in a dramatic effort to stop Republicans from holding a vote that could determine the balance of power in the US Congress. Republican Governor Greg Abbot has issued orders that they be arrested on sight - and fined $500 a day. He has also threatened to expel them from office. The Democrats left because at least two-thirds of the 150-member legislative body must be present to proceed with a vote on re-drawing Texas's electoral map. The plan would create five more Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives. This high stakes battle may seem both bizarre and confusing – but it is one that could spread to other states in advance of next year's national midterm elections. At its heart, it's a bare-knuckle fight over political power, who can wield it most effectively and who can keep it. Why does Trump want redistricting? The US House of Representatives is made up of 435 legislators who are elected every two years. They represent districts with boundaries determined in processes set by their state governments. Who draws the lines and how can go a long way in shaping the ideological tilt of the district and the likelihood that it elects a Democrat or a Republican. At the moment, the House rests on a knife edge with 219 Republicans and 212 Democrats. There are four vacancies likely to be filled by three Democrats and one Republican in special elections later this year. It wouldn't take much of a shift in the political winds for Democrats to take back control of the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections. And the party that controls the lower chamber of Congress has powers that extend far beyond simply setting the legislative agenda for the next two years, as important as that may be. House leaders can launch sweeping investigations of presidential actions, as Democrats did in the second half of Donald Trump's first term and Republicans did in Joe Biden's final two years. They can also dig in on policy issues and trigger government shutdowns. They can even vote to impeach a president, as Democrats did in December 2019 and Republicans contemplated during Biden's presidency. Trump appears focused on taking steps to improve his odds of avoiding a similar fate in his second term. He is reportedly fixated on the midterm races and encouraging Texas lawmakers to draw new congressional maps that could increase the likelihood of Republicans winning more House seats from there. How does redistricting usually work? Watch: What is gerrymandering? We use gummy bears to explain District lines are typically redrawn every 10 years, after a national census, to reflect shifts in the population within and between states. The most recent regularly scheduled redistricting took place in 2021. In some states, the process is set by independent commissions but in others the state legislatures are responsible for line-drawing – and the results can frequently be crafted by the party in power to give their side a distinct advantage. In North Carolina, for instance, Republican-drawn lines gave their party 10 of the state's 14 House seats in last year's national elections even though Trump only won the state by a slim margin. Democrats in Illinois hold 14 of the state's 17 House seats, while former Vice-President Kamala Harris won the state with 54%. If Trump has his way, and the maps lead to a five-seat gain next year, Republicans would control 30 of the state's 38 seats. Last year, he won Texas with 56%. So what could happen next? The Republican push in Texas has leaders in Democratic-controlled states calling for a response, which could set off a redistricting \"arms race\" that spreads across the country. California Governor Gavin Newsom, for example, has asked legislators in his state, where Democrats control 43 of the 52 seats, to find ways to increase their advantage. Governors Kathy Hochul in New York and JB Pritzker in Illinois have issued similar calls. \"Everything's on the table,\" Pritzker wrote in a post on social media. \"We've got to do everything we can to stand up and fight back - we're not sitting around and complaining from the sidelines when we have the ability to stop them.\" Texas Republicans vote to arrest Democrats blocking redistricting Democrats flee Texas to block Republican redistricting map Grassroots Democrats, many of whom have been frustrated by the inability of their party's national political leaders to block the Trump administration's policy agenda, may welcome such confrontational language. States like California and New York have laws that mandate congressional districts be drawn by a bipartisan commission to create constituencies that are compact and fair. Such efforts were the result of a push to remove po",

    "body": "More than 100 missing after flash floods in India 38 minutes ago Share Save Nitin Ramola Reporting from Uttarkashi Nikita Yadav BBC News, Delhi Share Save State Disaster Response Force Uttarkashi handout/EPA/Shutterstock Heavy rains and flash floods have caused severe damage in Uttarkashi district More than 100 people are missing and at least one has died after a cloudburst triggered devastating flash floods in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand. Rescue operations are underway in Uttarkashi district after a massive wave of water surged down the mountains into Dharali village on Tuesday, submerging roads and buildings in its path. Some army teams have been stationed in Dharali since Tuesday, but other disaster response forces and district officials have been unable to reach the area due to damaged roads and heavy rainfall. Nitin Ramola Roads leading to Dharali have been badly damaged Heavy rains have been lashing the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand over the past few weeks, and Uttarkashi, where Dharali village is located, has been particularly affected, with flooding reported in many places. Around 130 people have been rescued so far in Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami told reporters on Wednesday morning. A cloudburst is an extreme, sudden downpour of rain over a small area in a short period of time, often leading to flash floods. It took place on Tuesday around 13:30 India time (08:00 GMT), causing the Kheerganga river to swell dramatically, sending tonnes of muddy water crashing down the hilly terrain. Dharali, a popular tourist destination in the summer, is located 2km (1.24 miles) from Harsil, which has a huge Indian army base. A camp of the paramilitary Indo-Tibetan Border Police is also located near the area. At least 10 soldiers stationed at the Harsil base are also missing, officials said. Rescue operations are progressing at a slow pace as there is a large amount of sludge and debris covering the area. Heavy rains which have continued into Wednesday have also complicated rescue efforts. Many routes on the main highway have been closed after they were heavily damaged in the downpour. There are gaping, jagged cracks running down many roads in Uttarkashi district. A few teams of the national and state disaster response forces stationed in Gangotri - about 18km from Dharali - have been at the site since Tuesday afternoon, but officials have been unable to contact them because of poor network connectivity and prolonged power outages. Indo-Tibetan Border Police/X Officials say they have rescued 37 people from Dharali village India's weather department has forecast heavy rainfall in the region over the coming days and has advised people to avoid travelling to areas prone to landslides. Schools have also been closed in some parts of the state. The sludge has also blocked part of the Bhagirathi river - which becomes India's holiest river Ganges once it travels downstream - forming an artificial lake that has submerged large areas, including a government helipad. Officials worry that if this water is not drained out quickly, it can pose a serious threat to towns and villages downstream. Reuters Rescue operations have been slow due to bad weather In the past few days, officials had issued multiple rain alerts, discouraging tourists from visiting the region. Dharali, a busy summer stop on the Char Dham Yatra pilgrimage, sees fewer visitors in monsoon season. The low footfall and warnings likely kept tourists safe during the deluge. Residents warn that a full crowd could have turned the incident into a far worse disaster. Uttarakhand, located in the western Himalayas, is highly vulnerable to flash floods and landslides. In 2021, more than 200 people died in flash floods triggered by a cloudburst. One of the worst disasters to hit Uttarakhand was in 2013, when a cloudburst caused devastating floods and landslides that destroyed several villages and towns. Much of the damage took place in Kedarnath town , which is popular with Hindu pilgrims. Thousands of people were swept away, and many bodies were never recovered.

    "title": "Two Chinese nationals charged with exporting Nvidia AI chips to China",
    "body": "Chinese nationals charged with exporting Nvidia AI chips to China 2 hours ago Share Save Osmond Chia Business reporter, BBC News Reporting from Singapore Share Save AFP via Getty Images Two Chinese nationals have been arrested and charged with illegally shipping millions of dollars' worth of powerful AI chips to China, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Tuesday. The DOJ alleged that over the last three years ALX Solutions, a company it said was run by Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, exported the chips from the US to China without the required licences. Court documents seen by the BBC allege the shipments included Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become a key focus of US export controls aimed at stopping China purchasing the cutting-edge technology. The case shows that smuggling its chips \"is a nonstarter,\" an Nvidia spokesperson said. Nvidia sells products to well-known partners who help to ensure that all sales comply with US export control rules, she added. \"Even relatively small exporters and shipments are subject to thorough review and scrutiny, and any diverted products would have no service, support or updates.\" According to court documents, California-based ALX Solutions had three known employees: Mr Geng handled the firm's finances, Ms Yang was its secretary, while its chief executive was not named in the documents. The DOJ said the three individuals exercised \"full decision-making authority and shipment coordination\" for the firm. Mr Geng was a permanent resident of California, and Ms Yang, was an \"illegal alien\" who had overstayed her visa, a DOJ statement said. Business records showed the company sent goods several times from the US to shipping firms in Singapore and Malaysia between October 2022 and July 2025, the DOJ said, noting that both countries are used as transit hubs to \"conceal illegal shipments\" to China. ALX never received payments from these shipping firms and would instead be paid by other companies based in Hong Kong and China. These included a $1m (£750,000) payment from a China-based firm in January 2024, said the DOJ. Last December, ALX sent a shipment with export-restricted computing chips - including Nvidia's H100 and GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs - which was checked by US customs, according to court documents. \"Neither ALX Solutions nor Geng or Yang applied for or obtained a license from the Commerce Department,\" the documents said. In one 2023 invoice valued at more than $28.4m, ALX allegedly declared to Super Micro Computer, a supplier of Nvidia chips, that the devices were ordered for a Singapore-based customer. But a US export control officer in Singapore could not verify that the chips arrived in the country and the company named did not exist at the listed location, the court document said. \"It appears that ALX Solutions shipped the Nvidia products to different end users.\" Super Micro did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC but said in a statement to the Reuters news agency that it was \"firmly committed to compliance with all US export control regulations.\" It added that it would not comment on an ongoing legal case but would cooperate with authorities in any such proceedings. Ms Yang was arrested on Saturday while Mr Geng surrendered himself to the authorities soon after, the DOJ said. The pair appeared in federal court in Los Angeles on Monday, the DOJ said. If found guilty they could face up to 20 years in prison. ALX Solutions does not appear to have a website, according to court documents. A website for ALX-Cloud, which specialises in cloud computing services, states that it is a subsidiary of the company. The BBC was unable to immediately locate  lawyers for Mr Geng and Ms Yang but has contacted ALX-Cloud to request a statement.

    "body": "No bullying found in Harry charity row, but blame for all sides 7 hours ago Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save Reuters Prince Harry left the Sentebale charity that he had co-founded There was no evidence of widespread bullying, harassment or misogyny at the Sentebale charity founded by Prince Harry, the charity regulator has found. The Charity Commission has published its findings into whistleblower allegations that followed a bitter boardroom dispute that saw Prince Harry resigning , along with several trustees, earlier this year. It has imposed no sanctions - and the current leadership, headed by Sophie Chandauka, will remain at the charity which supports young people in southern Africa. But the commission did criticise \"all parties\" for allowing a \"damaging\" dispute to play out publicly - and gave the charity a regulatory action plan to deal with \"governance weaknesses\". Harry hopes watchdog will uncover 'truth' in charity row Harry charity engulfed by cash fears, insiders claim Harry quits charity he set up in Diana's honour over internal row It's a bittersweet outcome for Prince Harry who has left the charity, which his spokesman said had been \"deeply personal\" to him. Much of the criticism from the commission focused on how the internal dispute descended into such a public argument in the media, which it said had damaged the charity's reputation. The row had seen Prince Harry accused of being a \"toxic\" brand by the charity's chair Ms Chandauka - and he had stepped down saying his and the trustees' relationship with her was broken \"beyond repair\" and saying that they had faced \" blatant lies \". \"Sentebale's problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity's reputation, risk overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardising the charity's ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve,\" said Charity Commission chief executive David Holdsworth. Although Prince Harry's team welcomed the finding that there had not been evidence of bullying, a spokesman said the report \"falls troublingly short\" in that the \"consequences of the current chair's actions will not be borne by her\". PA Media Sophie Chandauka says the charity will continue and grow stronger The current chair, Ms Chandauka, remains at the head of the charity, with the watchdog finding no reason for her not to continue. A Sentebale spokesman said that the report confirmed that the new trustees had been validly appointed and could move forward \"free from interference\". Ms Chandauka said the \"adverse media campaign\" from those who had resigned from the charity had caused \"incalculable damage\". \"We are emerging not just grateful to have survived, but stronger,\" she said. The Charity Commission also said that although there was no evidence of widespread or systemic bullying or harassment, including misogyny or misogynoir [discrimination against black women], it acknowledged a \"strong perception of ill treatment felt by a number of parties\" and said it wasn't its role as a regulator to adjudicate on individual claims of bullying. The commission has not sanctioned any individuals, but its regulatory action plan is meant to address problems such as a lack of clarity over roles and a better mechanism for handling internal disputes. It warned of \"weaknesses in the charity's management\" that had added to disagreements. The inquiry highlighted how tensions had risen around a new fundraising strategy in the United States, with some trustees believed to have raised concerns about the charity's finances . The action plan warns of the importance of \"sufficient funding to enable the charity to deliver for its beneficiaries\". The Charity Commission website is still showing Sentebale's financial position from August 2023 - but sources close to the charity say it is in good financial health. The charity had been a very personal project for Prince Harry, which made his resignation even more difficult. Sentebale had been co-founded with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with both honouring the legacies of their mothers. \"For 19 years, its dedicated staff and steadfast supporters have provided vital care to over 100,000 young people across southern Africa, including young people living with HIV/Aids and those facing mental health challenges,\" said a spokesman for Prince Harry. Prince Harry's spokesman said the charity had been grown to become a \"flowering force for good\" and that he will \"now focus on finding new ways to continue supporting the children of Lesotho and Botswana\". Ms Chandauka said: \"Despite the recent turbulence, we will always be inspired by the vision of our founders, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso.\" The Charity Commission concluded that those running charities should not let disagreements make them forget their initial good intentions and to focus on those they were trying to help. \"Passion for a cause is the bedrock of volunteering and charity, delivering positive impact for ",

    "body": "BBC Studios Privacy Policy Page updated: 3 July 2025 Version 1.0 This policy describes what personal information (also known as personal data) BBC Studios collects, how we’ll use it, the circumstances in which it may be shared, and your rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. We may also provide additional notices to provide more information about what we will do with your information. For example, our Cookies Notice explains how we use web technologies such as cookies. If you are a California resident, see here for our California Notice at Collection and information provided pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act. What this policy covers Information we collect about you How we use your information When we share your information Where we store your information How long we keep your information How we secure your information Children using our services Your rights and choices Changes to this policy Contact Us Additional notices 1. WHAT THIS POLICY COVERS BBC Studios is the commercial production and distribution arm of the British Broadcasting Corporation (the ‘BBC’). We are a global business operating as BBC Studios Distribution, BBC Studios Productions, and BBC Global News (and their subsidiaries). Find out more about our group of companies and their locations . This Privacy Policy relates to our global content distribution and marketing activities, including: International version of the BBC website, BBC.com (English-language only). Advertising on BBC World Service websites. Portfolio of international BBC channels and on-demand services. Digital services and events for our shows (e.g. topgear.com, bluey.tv, doctorwho.tv, bbcearth.com and bbcshop.com). Industry events, like BBC Showcase. Sale of advertising and sponsorship solutions across the BBC’s international and branded services. What’s not covered in this policy? BBC Public Service: The use of your personal information by the BBC Public Service, which is a publicly funded service in and for the UK and therefore operates differently to BBC Studios which is a commercially funded business. This includes the BBC website in the UK (bbc.co.uk), any UK BBC account (as explained in more detail below), UK public services that are not geo-restricted (such as BBC Bitesize and the BBC programme pages), and the international World Service language sites. It also includes personal information collected when you comment on BBC News and BBC Sport articles or send in your photos and videos to News teams. These are all covered by the BBC Public Service privacy policy, which you can view here . Linked Services: Sometimes we link to other companies’ services, like articles published on other sites. Similarly, you might engage with our content and brands via another platform or company. For example, we publish our content on other platforms, like YouTube, Facebook and other social media, and news aggregators.  These external services will have their own privacy policies which will apply to their collection and use of your personal information. Third-Party Services : We also license our brands and content to other companies who produce their own websites, events, products and digital content. These companies are responsible for any personal information they collect about you in this context. Your personal information is not shared by these companies with BBC Studios unless it is a joint activity or you are otherwise informed that it will be shared. For example, if you have opted in to receive branded newsletters from us, your email address will be shared to enable us to send this to you as you have requested. Contributors: If you are a contributor to one of our programmes, the processing of your information by BBC Studios Productions is covered by its Contributor Privacy Policy , unless expressly indicated otherwise. Employees: Employees, workers and contractors should refer to the BBC People Privacy Notice. Candidates: Candidates and applicants for roles at BBC Studios should refer to the BBC Careers Site Privacy Notice . 2. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU The types of information we collect depends on the circumstances and the service you are using. We may collect information relating to you and/or your use of our services in the following ways: A.  Information collected from you directly When you use our services, register for a BBC account (outside the UK), submit comments or other content, attend one of our events or you otherwise interact with us (such as through social media platforms, our apps or engaging with our sales teams, responding to surveys), we will ask you for information relevant to the circumstances. If it isn’t obvious why we are asking for certain information, we will explain this to you at the time we collect it. We collect sensitive information about you - such as personal information concerning your race or ethnicity, political opinions, religion, health or sexual orientation - when it is relevant and necessa",
